      <description>From SVembu  1/ One of the psychological and spiritual effects of concentration of talent (which is what large scale urbanization ultimately is about) is the &amp;ldquo;rat race&amp;rdquo;.Large urban areas don&amp;rsquo;t give us space - the sheer physical room, and young children acutely perceive that lack of space. 2/ If you are talented and caught in that rat race, moving to a smaller community may cure it. You will simply stop caring about many of the &amp;ldquo;prestige traps&amp;rdquo; that afflict our minds - what brands of clothes, shoes, phones, cars and so on and on.</description>
