      <description>sAmarkaND  (via MT:) Al BalAdhurI describing the desecration of Iranian temples in Samarkand by the monstrous Qutaybah bin Muslim: &amp;ldquo;They destroyed the temple of the idols and the fire temples. The idols were thrown out, plundered of their ornaments, and burned, although the Parsis used to say that among them was one idol with which whoever trifled would perish. But when Qutaybah set fire to it with his own hand, many of them accepted Islam.</description>

Mani the syncretic incarnation Mani&amp;rsquo;s (216-276/77) parents were members of the Jewish Christian Gnostic sect known as the Elcesaites.
Mani believed that the teachings of Gautama Buddha, Zoroaster, and Jesus were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the &amp;ldquo;Religion of Light&amp;rdquo;. Manichaean tradition is also noted to have claimed that Mani was the reincarnation of different religious figures such as Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, and Jesus.</description>

He declared that their defeat was due to them having no horse-standard and recommended that they invoke the Suelde Tengri the god of the horse-banner. Then appeared 9 divine brothers armed with swords, tiger-skin quivers and bows, the eldest of whom was Suelde Tengri, riding fiery horses (corresponding to the nine horse tails of the banner).</description>
