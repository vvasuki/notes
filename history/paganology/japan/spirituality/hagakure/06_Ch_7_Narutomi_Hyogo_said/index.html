  <p>Narutomi Hyogo said, “What is called winning is
defeating one’s allies. Defeating one’s allies is defeating oneself, and defeating oneself is vigorously
overcoming one’s own body.
“It is as though a man were in the midst of ten thousand
allies but not a one were following him. If one hasn’t previously
mastered his mind and body, he will not defeat the enemy.”
During the Shimabara Rebellion, his armor being still at the
encampment, Shugyo Echizen no kami Tanenao participated in
the fight dressed only in hakama and haori. It is said that he
died in battle in this attire.
At the time of the attack on the castle at Shimabara, Tazaki
Geki was wearing very resplendent armor. Lord Katsushige was
not pleased by this, and after that every time he saw something
showy he would say, “That’s just like Geki’s armor.”
In the light of this story, military armor and equipment that
are showy can be seen as being weak and having no strength.
By them one can see through the wearer’s heart.
When Nabeshima wizen no kami Tadanao died, his attendant Ezoe Kinbei took his remains and had them consecrated
at Mt. Kola. Then, confining himself in a hermitage, he carved
a statue of his master and another of himself doing reverence before the master. On the first anniversary of Tadanao’s death, he
returned to his home and committed tsuifuku. Later the statue
was taken from Mt. Koya and was placed at the Kodenji.
In the generation of Lord Mitsushige, Oishi Kosuke was at
first a foot soldier serving at the side of his master. Whenever Lord Mitsushige was making the trip for his alternate- year
residence in Edo, Kosuke would make the rounds around the
sleeping quarters of his master, and if he thought a certain area
to be insecure, he would spread a straw mat and pass through
the night awake by himself. In rainy weather he would simply
wear a bamboo hat and an oilpaper raincoat and would stand
watch while being pelted by the rain. It is said that to the end
he never spent a single night in negligence .
When Oishi Kosuke was an uchitonin, a mysterious person
sneaked into the area of the maids’ chambers late at night.’
There was a great commotion from upstairs to down and men
and women of all ranks were running about; only Kosuke was not
to be seen. While the senior ladies-in- waiting were searching
about, Kosuke yanked his sword from its scabbard and waited
quietly in the room next to the master’s bedchamber. As all
was in confusion, he had felt apprehension for the master and
was there to protect him. Because of this it was said that his
viewpoint was quite different.
The man who had sneaked in was Narutomi Kichibei. He
and his accomplice Hamada Ichizaemon were condemned to
death for adultery.
Once when Lord Katsushige was hunting at Nishime, for
some reason he got very angry. He drew his sword from his obi,
scabbard and all, and began beating Soejima Zennojo with it,
but his hand slipped and his sword fell into a ravine. Zennojo,
in order to stay with the sword, fumbled down into the ravine
and picked it up. This done, he stuck the sword in his lapel,
crawled up the precipice, and just as he was, offered the sword
to his master. In terms of quick- mindedness and reserve this
was matchless resource.
Once when Master Sane Ukyo was crossing over the Takao
River, the bridge was being repaired and there was one large
piling that could not be pulled up. Master Ukyo dismounted,
grasped the piling firmly, pave a shout, and began to pull it up.
There was a tremendous sound, and although he was able to pull
it up to his own height, it would go no further and thereupon
sank. After he returned home he became sick and suddenly
died.
At the time of the funeral at the temple in Jobaru, when the
funeral procession crossed the Takao Bridge, the corpse leapt
from the casket and fell into the river. A sixteen-year- old
acolyte from the Shufukuji immediately jumped into the river
and took hold of the dead body. Everyone then ran down into
the river and pulled up the corpse. The head monk was very
impressed and instructed the other acolytes to be guided by this
young man. It is said that he later became a very famous monk.
Yamamoto Kichizaemon was ordered by his father Jin’-emon
to cut down a dog at the age of five, and at the age of fifteen
he was made to execute a criminal. Everyone, by the time they
were fourteen or fifteen, was ordered to do a beheading without
fail. When Lord Katsushige was young, he was ordered by Lord
Naoshige to practice killing with a sword. It is said that at that
time he was made to cut down more than ten men successively.
A long time ago this practice was followed, especially in the
upper classes, but today even the children of the lower classes
perform no executions, and this is extreme negligence. To say
that one can do without this sort of thing, or that there is no
merit in killing a condemned man, or that it is a crime, or that
it is defiling, is to make excuses. In short, can it not be thought
that because a person’s martial valor is weak, his attitude is
only that of trimming his nails and being attractive?
If one investigates into the spirit of a man who finds these
things disagreeable, one sees that this person gives himself over
to cleverness and excuse making not to kill because he feels
unnerved. But Naoshige made it his orders exactly because this
is something that must be done.
Last year I went to the Kase Execution Grounds to try my
hand at beheading, and I found it to be an extremely good
feeling. To think that it is unnerving is a symptom of cowardice.
Among the pageboys in forelocks in Lord Mitsushige’s retinue, one Tomoda Shozaemon was in attendance. A rather wanton fellow, he fell in love with a leading actor of the theater by
the name of Tamon Shozaemon and changed both his name and
his crest to that of the actor. Completely abandoning himself to
this affair, he spent everything he had and lost all his clothing
and furnishings. And at length, when he had exhausted all his
means, he stole Mawatari Rokubei’s sword and had a spearman
take it to a pawnshop.
The spearman, however, spoke up about this matter, and in
the investigation both he and Shozaemon were condemned to
death. The investigator was Yamamoto Gorozaemon. When he
read the report, he spoke in a loud voice and said, “The man
who accuses the defendant is Spearman so-and-so.”
Mitsushige responded quickly, “Put him to death.”
When it came time to announce his fate to Shozaemon,
Gorozaemon came in and said, “There is now nothing left to
be done for you. Prepare yourself for your place of death.”
Shozaemon settled himself and said, “Very well. I understand
what you have said and am grateful for your words.” Due to
somebody’s trickery, however, while a kaishaku was introduced
to Shozaemon, it was arranged that a foot soldier, Naozuka
Rokuuemon, was to step from the side and decapitate him.
Repairing to the execution grounds, where the kaishaku stood
opposite him, Shozaemon saluted him with extreme calm. But
just then, seeing Naozuka drawing his sword, he jumped up and
said, “Who are you? I’ll never let you cut off my head!” From
that point on his peace of mind was shattered and he showed terrible cowardice. Finally he was brought to the ground, stretched
out, and decapitated.
Gorozaemon later said secretly, ’ ’If he hadn’t been deceived,
he would have probably met his death well.”
Noda Kizaemon said about the function of kaishaku, “When
a man who has come to his place of death loses his wits and is
crawling about, it is likely seine damage will be done when it
comes time to perform kaishak. At such a time first wait a bit
and by some means gather your strength. Then if you cut by
standing firm and not missing the chance, you will do well.”
In the generation of Lord Katsushige there were retainers
who, regardless of high or low rank, were requested to work
before the master from the time they were young. When Shiba
Kizaemon was doing such service, once the master was clipping
his nails and said, “Throw these away.” Kizaemon held them
in his hand but did not stand up, and the master said, “What’s
the matter?” Kizaemon said, “There’s one missing.” The master
said, ’ ’Here it is,” and banded over the one that he had hidden.
Sawabe Heizaemon was ordered to commit seppuku on the
eleventh day of the eleventh month in the second year of Tenna.
As this became known to him on the night of the tenth, he sent
a request to Yamamoto Gonnojo [Tsunetomo] to be kaishaku.
The following is a copy of Yamamoto’s reply. (Tsunetomo was
twenty-four years old at this time.)
I am in accord with your resolution and accept your request
for me to function as kaishaku. I instinctively felt that I should
decline, but as this is to take place tomorrow there is no time for
making excuses and I will undertake the job. The fact that you
have chosen me from among many people is a great personal
satisfaction to me. Please set your mind at ease concerning all
that must follow. Although it is now late at night, I will come
to your house to talk over the particulars.
When Heizaemon saw this reply, it is said that he remarked,
”This is a matchless letter.“
From ages past it has been considered ill-omened by samurai
to be requested as kaishaku. The reason for this is that one pains
no fame even if the job is well done. And if by chance one should
blunder, it becomes a lifetime disgrace.
Once when Tanaka Yahei was attending to affairs in Edo,
one of his menials was rather insolent and Yahei scolded him
severely. Late that night Yahei heard the noise of someone coming up the stairs. He felt this to be suspicious and quietly got
up. With short sword in hand he asked who was there, and it
turned out to be the menial whom he had scolded previously,
secretly holding a short sword. Yahei leapt down and with a single stroke cut the man down. I heard many people later state
that he had had good luck.
A certain Master Tokuhisa was born quite different from
other people and looked to be a bit moronic. Once, a guest was
invited and mudfish salad was served. At that time everyone
said, ”Master Tokuhisa’s mudfish salad,“ and laughed. Later
when he was in attendance and a certain person made fun of
him by quoting the above remark, Tokuhisa pulled out his sword
and cut the man down. This event was investigated and it was
stated to Lord Naoshige, “Seppuku is recommended because this
was a matter of rashness within the palace.”
When Lord Naoshige heard this, he said, ’ ’To be made fun
of and remain silent is cowardice. There is no reason to overlook
this fact because one is within the palace. A man who makes
fun of people is himself a fool. It was his own fault for being cut
down.”
Once when Nakano Mokunosuke boarded a small boat on
the Sumida River to enjoy the coolness, a rogue got in too and
committed all manner of rude acts. When Mokunosuke saw that
the rogue was relieving himself over the side of the boat, he cut
the man’s head off and it fell into the river. So that people
would not notice this, he quickly covered the body with various
things. He then said to the boatman, “This matter should not
become known. Row up to the upper reaches of the river and
bury the corpse. I shall naturally pay you well.”
The boatman did as he was told, but in the lagoon where
the body was buried Mokunosuke cut off the head of the boatman and returned directly. It is said that this fact never became
known publicly. At that time there was also one young homosexual male prostitute riding in the boat. Mekunosuke said,
“That fellow was a man too. It is best to learn how to cut a
man while one is still young,” and so the man cut the corpse
once. Because of that the young man said nothing later on.
It is said that every time Oki Hyobu’s group gathered and
after all their affairs were finished he would say, “Young men
should discipline themselves rigorously in intention and courage.
This will be accomplished if only courage is fixed in one’s heart.
If one’s sword is broken, he will strike with his hands. If his
hands are cut off, he will press the enemy down with his shoulders. If his shoulders are cut away, he will bite through ten or
fifteen enemy necks with his teeth. Courage is such a thing.”
Shida Kichinosuke said, “At first it is an oppressive thing to
run until one is breathless. But it is an extraordinarily good
feeling when one is standing around after the running. More
than that, it is even better to sit down. More than that, it
is even better to lie down. And more than that, to put down
a pillow and sleep soundly is even better. A man’s whole life
should be like this. To exert oneself to a great extent when one
is young and then to sleep when he is old or at the point of
death is the way it should be. But to first sleep and then exert
oneself . . . To exert oneself to the end, and to end one’s whole
life in toil is regrettable.” Shimomura Rokurouemon told this
story.
A saying of Kichinosuke’s that is similar to this is, “A man’s
life should be as toilsome as possible.”
When Ueno Rihei was overseer of accounting in Edo, he
had a young assistant whom he treated in a very intimate way.
On the first night of the eighth month he went drinking with
Hashimoto Taemon, an overseer of foot soldiers, and got so
drunk that he lost good sense. He accompanied his young assistant back home, babbling on in a drunken manner, and when
they arrived there, Rihei said that he was going to cut the assistant down. The assistant pushed away the tip of Rihei’s scabbard. They grappled and both fell into the gutter with the
assistant on top pushing Rihei down. At this time, Rihei’s servant ran up and asked, “Is Master Rihei on the top or on the
bottom?”
When Rihei replied, ”I’m on the bottom !” the servant
stabbed the assistant once. The assistant got up and, as his
wound was light, ran away.
When the affair was brought under investigation, Rihei was
put into confinement at the Naekiyama prison and was condemned to capital punishment by beheading. Before this, when
he was positioned in Edo and living in a rented house in the
merchants’ district, a servant had opposed him and he had cut
him down. But he had acted in a good way at that time, and
people said that he had acted like a man. This time, however,
his actions were outrageous and were certainly unnecessary.
If one thinks about this well from beginning to end, to get
so drunk as to draw one’s sword is both cowardice and lack of
resolve. Rihei’s servant was a man from Taku, but his name is
not remembered. Though he was a member of the lower classes,
he was a brave man. It is said that Taemon committed suicide
during the investigation.
In the twelfth section of the fifth chapter of the Ryoankyo
there is this story:
In the Province of Wizen there was a certain man from Take
who, although he had contracted smallpox, was considering joining the forces attacking the castle at Shimabara. His parents
earnestly tried to get him to desist, saying, “With such a grave
illness, even if you should get there, how could you be of any
use?”
He replied, “It would be to my satisfaction to die on the
way. After having received the warm benevolence of the master,
should I tell myself that I will be of no use to him now?” And he
left for the front. Although it was winter camp and the cold was
extreme, he did not pay any attention to his health, and neither
put on many layers of clothing nor took off his armor day or
night. Moreover, he did not avoid uncleanliness, and in the end
recovered quickly and was able to fulfill his loyalty completely.
So to the contrary of what you would expect, it cannot be said
that one is to despise uncleanliness.
When the teacher, Suzuki Shozo, heard this, he said, “Was
it not a cleansing act to throw away his life for his master? For
a man who will cut of his life for the sake of righteousness, there
is no need to call upon the god of smallpox. All the gods of
heaven will protect him. ” Lord Katsushige said, “Whether a
man of Hizen holds death in regret or not is not a matter of
concern. What I worry about is that people will not take to
heart the command to keep the rules of manners and etiquette
correctly. I am afraid that the entire clan, our relatives and
elders, out of too much earnestness, will feel that the command
to keep correct etiquette is an exaggeration. Up to now there
have existed men who were used to these things, and even if
etiquette was slightly wrong, they could remember the correct
way, and the matter was settled. I have given this command
because people are negligent in affairs of this sort.”
During the Genroku period there was a samurai of low rank
from the Province of Ise by the name of Suzuki Rokubei. He
was ill with a severe fever, and his consciousness became dim.
At that time a certain male nurse was unexpectedly stricken
with greed and was about to open up the inkbox and steal the
money that was kept in it. Just then the sick man suddenly
stirred, took the sword from the base of his pillow, and in a
sudden attack cut the man down with one blow. With that, the
sick man fell back and died. By this act, Rokubei seemed to be
a man of principled disposition.
I heard this story in Edo, but later when I was serving in
the same province with a Dr. Nagatsuka, who was also from the
Province of Ise, I asked him about it, and indeed he knew the
story and said that it was true.</p>
