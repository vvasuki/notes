  <p>When Lord Takanobu was at the Battle of Bungo,
a messenger came from the enemy camp bearing
sake and food. Takanobu wanted to partake of
this quickly, but the men at his side stopped him,
saying, “Presents from the enemy are likely to be poisoned. This
is not something that a general should eat.”
Takanobu heard them out and then said, “Even if it is poisoned, how much of an effect would that have on things? Call
the messenger here!” He then broke open the barrel right in
front of the messenger, drank three large cups of sake, offered
the messenger one too, gave him a reply, and sent him back to
his camp.
Takagi Akifusa turned against the Ryuzoji clan, appealed
to Maeda Iyo no kami Iesada, and was sheltered by him. Akifusa was a warrior of matchless valor and was an accomplished
and agile swordsman. His retainers were Ingazaemon and Fudozaemon, stalwarts in no way inferior, and they left Akifusa’s
side neither day nor night. Thus it happened that a request
was sent from Lord Takanobu to Iesada to kill Akifusa. At one
point, when Akifusa was seated on the veranda having Ingazaemon wash his feet, Iesada came running up behind him and
struck off his head, Before his head fell, Akifusa drew out his
short sword and turned to strike, but cut off Ingazaemon’s head.
The two heads fell into the wash basin together. Akifusa’s head
then rose into the midst of those present. This was the sort of
magic technique that he consistently had.
The priest Tannen used to say in his daily talks that: A
monk cannot fulfill the Buddhist Way if he does not manifest
compassion without and persistently store up courage within.
And if a warrior does not manifest courage on the outside and
hold enough compassion within his heart to burst his chest, he
cannot become a retainer. Therefore, the monk pursues courage
with the warrior as his model, and the warrior pursues the com84
passion of the monk.
I traveled about for many years and met men of wisdom but
never found the means to the pursuit of knowledge. Therefore,
whenever I heard of a man of courage in one place or another,
I would go and look for him regardless of the hardships on the
way. I have learned clearly that these stories of the Way of the
Samurai have been an aid on the road to Buddhism. Now a
warrior with his armor will rush into the enemy camp, making
that armor his strength. Do you suppose that a monk with a
single rosary can dash into the midst of spears and long swords,
armed with only meekness and compassion? If he does not have
great courage, he will do no dashing at all. As proof of this, the
priest offering the incense at a great Buddhist memorial service
may tremble, and this is because he has no courage.
Things like kicking a man back from the dead, or pulling
all living creatures out of hell, are all matters of courage. Nevertheless, monks of recent times all entertain false ideas and
desire to become laudably gentle; there are none who complete
the Way. Furthermore, among warriors there are some cowards
who advance Buddhism. These are regrettable matters. It is
a great mistake for a young samurai to learn about Buddhism.
The reason is that he will see things in two ways. A person who
does not set himself in just one direction will be of no value at
all. It is fine for retired old men to learn about Buddhism as
a diversion, but if a warrior makes loyalty and filial piety one
load, and courage and compassion another, and carries these
twenty-four hours a day until his shoulders wear out, he will be
a samurai.
In one’s morning and evening worship, and as one goes about
his day, he had best recite the name of his master. It is not a
bit different from the Buddha’s names and holy words. Furthermore, one should be in harmony with his family gods. These
are matters of the strength of one’s fate. Compassion is like a
mother who nurtures one’s fate. Examples of the ruin of merciless warriors who were brave alone are conspicuous in both past
and present.
There was a certain point in the conversation when a retainer
of Lord Nabeshima Naohiro said, “There are no men here upon
whom the master can truly rely. Although I am consistently
useless, I am the only one who would throw away his life for
you.”
It is said that Lord Naohiro got outrageously angry, saying,
“Among our retainers there is not a one who holds his life in
regret! You are talking arrogance!” and he was at the point of
striking him when the man was pulled away by others who were
there.
Once when Master Tanesada, the founder of the China family, was coming by sea to the island of Shikoku, a strong wind
began blowing and the boat was damaged. The boat was saved
from sinking by abalone gathering together and covering over
the damaged sections. From that time on none of the China
family nor any of its retainers ate abalone. If one of them mistakenly ate one, it is said that his body was covered with boils
in the shape of abalone.
At the fall of the castle at Arima, on the twenty-eighth day
in the vicinity of the inmost citadel, Mitsuse Gender sat down
on a levee between the fields. When Nakano Shintohi passed by
and asked the reason for this, Mitsuse replied, “I have abdominal
pains and can’t go a step farther. I have sent the members of
my group ahead, so please take command.” This situation was
reported by the overseer, pronounced to be a case of cowardice,
and Mitsuse was ordered to commit seppuku.
Long ago, abdominal pains were called “cowardice grass.”
This is because they come suddenly and render a person immobile.
At the time of Lord Nabeshima Naohiro’s death, Lord Mitsushige forbade Naohiro ’s retainers the practice of tsuifuku.
His messenger went to Naohiro’s mansion and made the declaration, but those who received this news could in no way agree to
it. From their midst Ishimaru Uneme (later called Seizaemon)
spoke from the lowest seat, “It is improper for me as a younger
person to speak out, but I think that what Lord Katsushige has
said is reasonable. As a person who received the master’s care
when I was young, I had whole- heartedly decided on tsuifuku.
But hearing Lord Katsushige’s dictum and being convinced of
his reasoning, no matter what the others may do, I am giving
up the idea of tsuifuku and will serve the master’s successor.”
Hearing this, the others all followed suit.
Once Lord Masaie was playing shogi with Lord Hideyoshi
and there were a number of daimyo watching. When it came
time to withdraw, although Lord Masaie could stand, his feet
were numb and he could not walk. He made his withdrawal
crawling away, causing everyone to laugh. Because Lord Masaie
was big and obese he was not ordinarily able to be on his knees.
After this event he thought it would not be fitting to he in
attendance anymore and began refusing such duties .
Nakano Uemonnosuke Tadaaki was killed on the twelfth day
of the eighth month in the sixth year of Eiroku, at the time of
the fight between Master Goto and Master Hirai of Suko on the
island of Kabashima in the Kishima district. When Uemonnosuke was leaving for the front lines, he emgraced his son Shikibu
(later called Jin’emon) in the garden and, although Shikibu was
very young, said, “When you grow up, win honor in the Way of
the Samurai!”
Even when the children in his family were very young, Yamamoto Jin’emon would draw near to them and say, “Grow up
to be a great stalwart, and be of good use to your master.” He
said, “It is good to breathe these things into their ears even when
they are too young to understand.”
When Ogawa Toshikiyo’s legitimate son Sahei Kiyoji died as
a youth, there was one young retainer who galloped up to the
temple and committed seppuku.
When Taku Nagato no kami Yasuyori passed away, Kola
Yataemon said that he had been unable to repay the master’s
kindness and committed seppuku.</p>
