  <p>When Shimomura Shoun was on service at the castle, Lord Naoshige said, “How wonderful it is that
Katsushige is so vigorous and powerful for his
age. In wrestling with his peers he even beat
those who are older than he is.”
Shoun replied, “Even though I’m an old man, I’ll bet I’m
best at seated wrestling.” So saying, he jerked up Katsushige
and threw him so forcefully that it hurt. He then said, “To
be prideful about your strength while your mettle is not yet
established is likely to bring you shame in the midst of people.
You are weaker than you look.” Then he withdrew.
At the time when Matsuda Yohei was an intimate friend
of Ishii Jinku’s, there developed some bad feelings between the
former and Nozoe Jinbei. Yohei sent word to Jinbei saying,
“Please come and I will settle this matter once and for all.” Then
he and Jinku set out together and, coming to the Yamabushi
mansion at Kihara, they crossed the only bridge there was and
destroyed it. Talking over the circumstances of the discord, they
examined them from all sides and found no reason to fight. But
when they decided to turn around and go home, there was, of
course, no bridge.
While they were looking for an appropriate way of crossing
the moat, the men whom the two had challenged could be seen
approaching stealthily. Yohei and Jinku saw this and said, “We
have passed the point of no return, and may as well fight rather
than be disgraced at a later date.” The battle lasted for some
time. Seriously wounded, Yohei fell down between two fields.
Jinbei also received a deep wound, and with blood flowing into
his eyes was unable to find Yohei. While Jinbei thus searched
about blindly, Yohei was able to hold him off from his prone
position and in the end cut him down. But when he attempted
to deliver the finishing blow, having no strength left in his hand,
he pierced Jinbei’s neck by pushing the sword with his foot.
At this point, friends arrived and accompanied Yohei back.
After his wounds healed he was ordered to commit seppuku. At
that time he called his friend Jinku, and they drank a farewell
cup together.
Okubo Toemon of Shioda ran a wineshop for Nabeshima
Kenmotsu. Lord Okura, the son of Nabeshima Kai no kami,
was a cripple and confined indoors in a place called Mine. He
harbored wrestlers and liked rowdies. The wrestlers would often go to nearby villages and cause disturbances. One time
they went to Toemon’s place, drank sake and talked unreasonably, bringing Toemon into an argument. He met them with a
halberd, but as there were two of them he was cut down.
His son, Kannosuke, was fifteen years old and was in the
midst of studies at the Jozeiji when he was informed of the
incident. Galloping off, he took a short sword about sixteen
inches in length, joined combat with the two big men, and in a
short time finished them both off. Although Kannosuke received
thirteen wounds, he recovered. Later he was called Doko and is
said to have become very adept at massage.
It is said that Tokunaga Kichizaemon repeatedly com- plained,
“I’ve grown so old that now, even if there were to be a battle,
I wouldn’t be able to do anything. Still, I would like to die by
galloping into the midst of the enemy and being struck down
and killed. It would be a shame to do nothing more than to die
in one’s bed.” It is said that the priest Gyojaku heard this when
he was an acolyte. Gyojaku’s master was the priest Yemen, who
was Kichizaemon’s youngest child.
When Sagara Kyuma was requested to become a chief retainer, he said to Nabeshima Heizaemon, “For some reason I
have been increasingly well treated by the master and now have
been requested to take a high rank. Not having a good retainer,
my affairs are liable to be in disorder. It is my request that you
give me your retainer, Takase Jibusaemon.” Heizaemon listened
to him and consented, saying, “It is very gratifying that you
have kept an eye on my retainer. I will therefore do as you ask.”
But when he related this to Jibusaemon, the latter said,
“I should reply directly to Master Kyuma.” He then went to
Kyuma’s place and talked with him. Jibusaemon told Kyuma,
“I know it is a great honor that you have thought well of me
and have made this request. But a retainer is a person who
cannot change masters. As you are of high rank, if I were to
become your retainer my life would be replete, but that repleteness would be a vexation to me. Because Her zaemon is of low
rank and is hard pressed, we live by eating cheap rice gruel. Yet
that is sweet enough. Please think this over.”
Kyuma was extremely impressed.
A certain man went of somewhere and on returning home
late at night, found that a strange man had slipped into the
house and was committing adultery with his wife. He thereupon killed the man. He then broke down a wall and propped
up a bale of rice, and by this arrangement submitted to the
authorities that he had killed a thief. Thus it went without
mishap. After some time had passed he divorced his wife and
the affair was finished.
When a certain person returned home from some place or
other, he found his wife committing adultery with a retainer
in the bedroom. When he drew near the two, his retainer fled
through the kitchen. He then went into the bedroom and slew
his wife.
Calling the maidservant, he explained what had happened
and said, “Because this would bring shame to the children, it
should be covered up as death by illness and I will need considerable help. If you think that this is too much for you, I may as
well kill you too for your part in this serious crime.”
She replied, “If you will spare my life, I will go on as if I
don’t know anything. ” She rearranged the room and set out
the corpse in its nightclothes. Then, after sending a man to
the doctor’s place two or three times saying that there was a
sudden illness, they sent a last messenger saying that it was too
late and there was no longer any need to come. The wife’s uncle
was called in and told about the illness, and he was convinced.
The entire affair was passed oft as death by illness, and to the
end no one knew the truth. At a later date the retainer was
dismissed. This affair happened in Edo.
At New Year’s in the third year of Keicho at a place in Korea
called Yolsan, when the armies of the Ming appeared by the
hundreds of thousands, the Japanese troops were amazed and
watched with bated breath. Lord Naoshige said, “Well, well.
That’s a great number of men ! I wonder how many hundreds
of thousands there are?”
Jin’emon said, “In Japan, for something that’s numberless
we say ’as many as the hairs on a threeyear- old calf.’ This
would certainly live up to the number of hairs on a three-yearold calf!” It is said that everybody laughed and regained their
spirits.
Later, Lord Katsushige was hunting at MI. Shiroishi and
told Nakano Matabei about this. ’ ’Except for your father who
spoke in such a way, there was no one who said even a word.”
Nakano Jin’emon constantly said, “A person who serves when
treated kindly by the master is not a retainer. But one who
serves when the master is being heartless and unreasonable is a
retainer. You should understand this principle well.”
When Yamamoto Jin’emon was eighty years old, he be- came
ill. At one point, he seemed to be on the verge of groaning,
and someone said to him, “You’ll feel better if you groan. Go
ahead. *’ But he replied, “Such is not the case. The name of
Yamamoto Jin’emon is known by everyone, and I have shown
up well throughout a whole lifetime. To let people hear my
groaning voice in my last moments would never do.” It is said
that he did not let out a groan to the very end.
A certain son of Mori Monbei got into a fight and returned
home wounded. Asked by Monbei, “What did you do to your
opponent?” his son replied, “I cut him down.”
When Monbei asked, “Did you deliver the coup de grace?”
his son replied, “Indeed I did.”’
Then Monbei said, “You have certainly done well, and there
is nothing to regret. Now, even if you fled you would have to
commit seppuku anyway. When your mood improves, commit
seppuku, and rather than die by another’s hand, you can die
by your father’s.” And soon after he performed kaishaku for his
son.
A man in the same group as Aiura Genzaemon committed
some nefarious deed, and so the group leader gave him a note,
condemning him to death, which was to be taken to Genzaemon’s place. Genzaemon perused the note and then said to the
man, “It says here that I should kill you, so I will do away with
you on the eastern bank. Previously you have practiced such
things as swordsmanship . . . . Now fight with all you’ve got.”
The man replied, “I will do as you say,” and with Genzaemon
alone accompanying him, they left the house. They had gone
about twenty yards along the edge of the moat when a retainer
of Genzaernon’s yelled out, “Hey, Hey!” from the other side. As
Genzaemon was turning around, the condemned man attacked
him with his sword. Genzaemon ducked backwards, drew his
sword, and cut the man down. He then returned home.
He put the clothes he had been wearing at that time into
a chest and locked them up, never showing them to anyone for
the rest of his life. After he died the clothes were examined,
and it was seen that they were rent. This was told by his son,
Genzaemon.
Okubo Doko is said to have remarked:
Everyone says that no masters of the arts will appear as the
world comes to an end. This is something that I cannot claim
to understand. Plants such as peonies, azaleas and camellias
will be able to produce beautiful flowers, end of the world or
not. If men would give some thought to this fact, they would
understand. And if people took notice of the masters of even
these times, they would be able to say that there are masters
in the various arts. But people become imbued with the idea
that the world has come to an end and no longer put forth any
effort. This is a shame. There is no fault in the times.
While Fukahori Magoroku was still living as a dependent
second son, he once went hunting at Fukahori, and his retainer,
mistaking him for a wild boar in the darkness of the undergrowth, fired the rifle, wounding him in the knee and causing
him to fall from a great height. The retainer, greatly upset,
stripped himself to the waist and was about to commit seppuku. Magoroku said, “You can cut your stomach open later. I
don’t feel well, so bring me some water to drink.” The retainer
ran about and obtained some water for his master to drink and
in the process calmed down. After that the retainer was again
about to commit seppuku, but Magoroku forcibly stopped him.
Upon returning they checked in with the man on guard, and
Magoroku asked his father, Kanzaemen, to forgive the retainer.
Kanzaemon said to the retainer, “It was an unexpected mistake, so do not be worried. There is no need for reservation.
Continue with your work.”
A man by the name of Takagi got into an argument with
three farmers in the neighborhood, was soundly beaten out in
the fields, and returned home. His wife said to him, “Haven’t
you forgotten about the matter of death?” “Definitely not!” he
replied.
His wife then retorted, “At any rate, a man dies only once.
Of the various ways of dying -dying of disease, being cut down in
battle, seppuku or being beheaded–to die ignominiously would
be a shame,” and went outside. She soon returned, carefully
put the two children to bed, prepared some torches, dressed
herself for battle after nightfall, and then said, “When I went
out to survey the scene a bit earlier, it seemed that the three
men went into one place for a discussion. Now is the right time.
Let’s go quickly!” So saying, they went out with the husband in
the lead, burning torches and wearing short swords. They broke
into their opponents’ place and dispersed them, both husband
and wife slashing about and killing two of the men and wounding
the other. The husband was later ordered to commit seppuku.</p>
