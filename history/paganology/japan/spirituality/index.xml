      <description>General intro  LW. relation to buddhism here.  kAmi as the base entities &amp;ldquo;Yoshida Kanetomo&amp;rsquo;s formulation of Shinto in the 14-1500s has a touch of brilliance such that he can be called Japan&amp;rsquo;s Astika. He developed the idea that the buddha-s and the bodhisattva-s are not the original entities but they are merely manifestation of the kami who are the original divine entities. He also made the case that bauddha and Confucianism are merely second hand versions of Shinto with the kami as the primary pantheon being secondarily interpreted as nAstika buddha-s of chIna deities.</description>
