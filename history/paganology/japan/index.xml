      <description>Conformity, collectivism They have been a culture with a high emphasis on conformity: it is important not to stand out - either in good or bad ways, unless the social role requires it.
People often think about what others think about them. Social honor is a big component of individual honor. In old days, some people were driven to commit suicide by hAra-kiri stoically as a matter of punishment or grief over shame.</description>

      <description>A Portuguese, writing in 1565, stated that most men and women in the great towns of Japan could read and write-quite an accomplishment considering that to be fully literate one had know 2k+ characters.</description>

Jomon and Ainu Observations The earlier peoples of Japan, the Jomon, were ancestors of the Ainu some of whom even today retain that Jomon ancestry in an unadulterated form. This Jomon-type ancestry is also seen elsewhere in east Asia like: 1. The Ulchi who live in eastern Russia &amp;amp; speak a Tungusic language. 2) They show relationship to the ancient Devils Gate people of Sikhote-Alin mountains of Russia who also show a similar admixture with the Jomon-like component as the Ulchi; 3) the ancient Hòabìnhian hunter gatherers of Vietnam also show some of this Jomon-Ainu like ancestry.</description>

      <description>Hindu Japanology  Awakening of interest - esp after Admiral Togo&amp;rsquo;s victory  &amp;ldquo;Here again a certain resonance was felt in bhArata. The great patriot Lokamanya Tilak who had discovered ancient evolutionary connections between the Shinto pantheon and that of the Indo-Europeans tacitly admitted that Hindus may learn from the uShAputra-s. Some of his followers even went to Japan to study their ways. With that things had come a full circle, over 1200 years ago the emperor Shomu had personally welcomed a bharadvAja brAhmaNa from Southern India who performed the installations of indra, sarasvatI and others.</description>
