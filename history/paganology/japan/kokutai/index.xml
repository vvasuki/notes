      <description>Post 16th century Japan. Provocations  planned subversion [SP], selling Japanese into slavery [H], rabid conversion [H], conversion for money [N] forcible conversions of the populace by Christian daimyo.  Iconoclasm  &amp;ldquo;The balance sheet for the three months spent by Valignano in Arima was as follows: All the temples of their camis and fotoques (gods and Buddhas) were broken up and destroyed - more than forty of them, large and small, among them some of the most beautiful and renowned in all Japan; and all the bonzes either turned Christian or left (Dom Protasio&amp;rsquo;s) lands.</description>
