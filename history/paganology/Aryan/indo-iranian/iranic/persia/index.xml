      <description>For religious background, see &amp;ldquo;betrayal to islam&amp;rdquo; page. Forced conversions: see here.  Conquest  &amp;ldquo;The Arab conquerors must have been astounded at how quickly they were able to overthrow the last Sasanian king. Yazdgard III (r. 632–651) had to abandon Ctesiphon, near the modern site of Baghdad, and fled for his life into the Asiatic steppe. But he was intercepted and killed. His sons and a few surviving aristocrats managed to reach China, where the Tang emperor welcomed them to his court at Chang’an.</description>

      <description>The Georgians don&amp;rsquo;t speak an IE language.  Early religion  &amp;ldquo;But what was their natural religion before being smothered by the evils of pretonmAda? The evidence from the victory announcements of the preta-s suggest that they were following the natural more eastern reflex of Iranian religion. So in a sense they are a parallel the Dravidians of India: different language family but same religion as their Arya neighbors. However, there are hints that there might have been an internal clash between Georgians who initially worshipped a more natural flavor of the Iranian religion &amp;amp; the Zoroastrians who insisted on uniconic worship.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot; Il-Khans had conquered Mesopotamia after annihilating the Shi’a power of the Hashishins and the Sunni Kilafat. So the Mohammedans were no longer a political force in Mesopotamia. Yet they were able to destroy the external influences and re-establish the Shari’a.&amp;rdquo; [MT] &amp;ldquo;Due to the Mohammedan persecution of various groups favored by Arghun he came up with a plan to conquer Mecca and restore heathen worship there with construction of temples of buddhakapAla and heruka, but due to other preoccupations he failed to do so.</description>

      <description>Early times  Iranian power in the world system arose somewhat later than ours. Although they were around in west Asia for sometime since 1000 BCE, they were not exactly a mighty force.
  &amp;hellip; [I] hold that a branch of these steppe kuru-s re-emerged with another allied clan the kamboja much later on the Iranians side to form the elite of the hAkamAnashIya dynasty. - MT
 Hākamanshiya empire  Although they were around in west Asia for sometime since 1000 BCE, they were not exactly a mighty force.</description>
