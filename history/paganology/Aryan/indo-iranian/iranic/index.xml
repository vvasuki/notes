      <description>&amp;ldquo;In 615 AD, the 3 Central Asian kingdoms of Kucha, Agni (later Qara Shahar) and Khotan (gosthAna/ oDDiyAna-pITha) were islands of the Indic civilization in the Tarim Basin. They were at the pinnacle of their power and prosperity and were great centers of Sanksritic learning, producing a variety of texts on buddhist and classical hindu philosophies. .. The new king of Kucha, suvarNadeva renewed the non-aggression pact with Tai-tsung, the expansionist Chinese emperor.</description>

      <description>shAka-s (scythian-s, Skudra – Sogdian – Saka) and kuShANa-s, early masters of horseback warfare at the end of chariot era, displaced by admixed huNa-s.  shaka-s included women warriors who might have inspired Amazon stories, interbred with mongols. Eg. Eastern shAka-s in Altai - YT.   &amp;ldquo;The invention of the stirrup itself remains murky – it is first seen in India and then in the steppes, yet the first major users of equestrian warfare were the steppe Indo-Iranians like the Shakas and Kushanas.</description>
