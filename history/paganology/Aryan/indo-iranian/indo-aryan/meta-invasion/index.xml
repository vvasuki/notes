      <description>Proper pramANa-s 
The above is from [Nature16].
 &amp;ldquo;First, a paper from 2006 is wildly out of date for this field. The methods used have been superseded. Instead of using one locus, the Y chromosome, and focusing on microsatellites (which have upsides and downsides), researchers now look at the whole genome.&amp;rdquo; RK15 &amp;ldquo;Dr. Underhill says there is no comparison between the kind of data available in 2010 and now. “Then, it was like looking into a darkened room from the outside through a keyhole with a little torch in hand; you could see some corners but not all, and not the whole picture.</description>

      <description>Correlation with language These were all accompanied by fairly massive invasions and gene movement.
 Take dominance of Turkish in Turkey, of Spanish in South and middle America, of English in North America, Australia and Africa, of Arabic in Egypt and North Africa, of Chinese in Tibet and the Uighur land, Japanese in Hokkaido, Russian in Eastern Siberia Sinhalese in Lanka Indic influence in South East Asia was accompanied by great population movement and domination (~5% of Cambodian ancestry seems to be Indian)  Problems  &amp;ldquo;glottochronology while a valid idea lacks the calibration which its relative in biological phylogenetics has: neither good fossils nor a molecular clock has been worked out.</description>

      <description>Key evidence  &amp;ldquo;The master key for discerning historical expansions and migrations is the internal chronology of the Rg-Veda. Basing himself on two centuries of Western scholarship, from 19th-century German Veda scholar Oldenburg to present-day AIT champion Prof. Michael Witzel, Talageri compares the contents of the oldest layer, largely coinciding with books 6, 3 and 7; of the middle layer, books 2 and 4; and the youngest layer, comprising books 1, 5, 8, 9 and 10.</description>

      <description>Early Arya vs shUdra conflict  Arya-s and dAsyu-s/ dAsa-s (mentioned int he Rg-veda) were enemies - differentiated by race(?) and culture. After subjugating the latter, they became shUdra-s in early Aryan society. (PV Kane)  Possible connection: Western shaka-s (who recided on the west coast of black sea) referred to themselves as skudra-s [SZ, दारयवः।].     &amp;ldquo;The post R^igvedic texts allude to the Arya vs shUdra conflict and the brahma+kShatra vs shUdra conflicts.</description>

      <description>Embracing AIT  In 1898 Tilak wrote &amp;ldquo;The Arctic Home in the Vedas&amp;rdquo;. This work propounded the theory that the North Pole was the original home of the Aryans in the pre-glacial period, who migrated to the Northern parts of Europe, Asia and eventually India by about 3000 BCE. Savarkar wrote a booklet named &amp;ldquo;Essentials Of Hindutva&amp;rdquo; in 1923 - a foundational document in the history of the movement. In that pamphlet, he implicitly accepts the Aryan Invasion theory by talking of Aryans as a distinct race.</description>
