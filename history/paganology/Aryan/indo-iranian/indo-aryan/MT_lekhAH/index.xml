      <description>Near Baramati lived a band of Kasar Gavlis, who sold their curds and milk in brass pots. One day they were visited by viShUchikA. They all died as a result. The vacuum was filled by a roving band of Maharatta tribals called the Bhosles. The Bhosles also took to breeding the gavlis’ cattle and trading milk and curd. They then were called the Gavlis. The original gavlis worshiped a horned buffalo deity called mhasobA.</description>

      <description>Masi Reddi and his wife Nilamama lived in the eastern ghats selling wood with their 6 sons. They invoked mahAdeva, who appeared in their house in the form of a jangama. He gave Nilamma some ashes and said they would become rich when another son was born. This son was Undala Padmanna. Soon they became prosperous by acquiring agriculture. However Padmanna never did any work. So his brothers decided to kill him.</description>

      <description>The Rathvas are a peculiar tribe in Gujarat whose art was studied by Jyotirindra Jain. Most tribes of India preserve certain aboriginal traits that have are often interlaced with Indo-Aryan tendencies. Most commonly the rudra cult of the the Indo-Aryans and its various ramifications has been used as a conduit for the assimilation of aboriginal tribes. Hence, the most frequent Indo-Aryan elements are associated with the worship of rudra and his entourage, and syncretization of local goddess into the pan-Indo-Aryan transfunctional goddess cult.</description>
