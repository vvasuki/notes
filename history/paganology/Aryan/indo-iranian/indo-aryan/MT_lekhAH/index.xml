      <description>The Indo-Aryans of the second millenium Middle East have been a topic of continuing interest highlighted beginning with the works of Johannes Friedrich in 1929. Subsequently, Mironov and PE Dumont have also expanded upon this subject. These studies are of key importance to the Aryan problem, which may be briefly described as the question of time and place of origin of the Indo-Aryan languages of India and its speakers. In my opinion the traces of Indo-Aryan in the Middle East are indisputable; however, it is clear that only words and no complete Indo-Aryan language surives in these regions.</description>

      <description>Indo-Aryans have heavily influenced the world by way to the movements of their genes, languages and culture. Let us compare some of these movements to understand their dynamics.
1) The invasion of the Indian sub-continent: After breaking away from the Balto-Slavic with which they are unified by the synapomorphies such as the Satem state and the classical RUKI rule the Indo-Iranian stem developed a distinctive culture for a period in the Eurasian grassland and its northern border zones.</description>

      <description>Near Baramati lived a band of Kasar Gavlis, who sold their curds and milk in brass pots. One day they were visited by viShUchikA. They all died as a result. The vacuum was filled by a roving band of Maharatta tribals called the Bhosles. The Bhosles also took to breeding the gavlis’ cattle and trading milk and curd. They then were called the Gavlis. The original gavlis worshiped a horned buffalo deity called mhasobA.</description>

      <description>Masi Reddi and his wife Nilamama lived in the eastern ghats selling wood with their 6 sons. They invoked mahAdeva, who appeared in their house in the form of a jangama. He gave Nilamma some ashes and said they would become rich when another son was born. This son was Undala Padmanna. Soon they became prosperous by acquiring agriculture. However Padmanna never did any work. So his brothers decided to kill him.</description>

      <description>The Rathvas are a peculiar tribe in Gujarat whose art was studied by Jyotirindra Jain. Most tribes of India preserve certain aboriginal traits that have are often interlaced with Indo-Aryan tendencies. Most commonly the rudra cult of the the Indo-Aryans and its various ramifications has been used as a conduit for the assimilation of aboriginal tribes. Hence, the most frequent Indo-Aryan elements are associated with the worship of rudra and his entourage, and syncretization of local goddess into the pan-Indo-Aryan transfunctional goddess cult.</description>
