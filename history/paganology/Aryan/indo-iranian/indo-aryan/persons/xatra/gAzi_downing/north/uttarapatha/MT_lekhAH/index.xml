      <description>The mahA-chInAchArya, shubhakara siMha, a nAstIka of the second varNa, was a remarkable, even if forgotten, figure in history largely forgotten in his homeland India. He was a descendent of the ikShvAku chieftain amR^itodana whose clan held a small kingdom in what is the border between modern Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. They were overthrown by the rAShTrakUTa army and as a consequence fled to oDDiyAna pITha in central Asia. Here they established themselves as rulers of oDDiyAna.</description>

      <description>Nilakantha Shastri brings attention to the Indian rulers of Khotan and has attempted to reconstruct their chronology from various sources.
Map of Khotan
In the period that followed the death of the great emperor lalitAditya, and the confusion during the reign of saMgrAmapIDa, the Chinese generals Yao Yao and Wei-ch’ih-Sheng devised a daring plan to take Khotan. With the help of the internal Sinitic population they engineered a revolt and suddenly appeared at the head of a massive Chinese army of 80,000 to beseige and conqueror the kingdom.</description>
