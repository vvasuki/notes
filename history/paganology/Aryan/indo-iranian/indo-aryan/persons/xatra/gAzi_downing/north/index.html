<li>jaya-simha 2 &ldquo;Sawai&rdquo; [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_Singh_II#Sawai_Jai_Singh_and_the_Marathas">wiki</a>] of amber
<ul>
<li>raised to serve mogol emperors but later took wings,</li>
<li>who like akaNNa and madaNNa conspired with the marATha-s to reduce Islamic power.</li>
<li>tried in vain to constrain jaT and marATha rise with a partial rAjaputra alliance.</li>
<li>whose force of 50,000 soldiers who were all well-educated, was the most modern army in the whole of India</li>
<li>brought a stop to extravagantly lavish weddings, female infanticide, etc. through strict orders</li>
<li>who built jantar mantar, patronized scholarship and even conducted an ashvamedha.</li>
<li>removed the jizya tax that was levied on tirthayatras and at tirthakshetras forever (When Bahadur Shah offered him a reward of two crores, he declined it and instead asked for an order for a permanent removal of the tax!)</li>
<li>had rest houses and Dharmashalas built at Mathura, Brindavan, Kashi, Gaya, Pune, Kabul, Lahore, Agra, Delhi, Chitrakoot, Ayodhya, Haridwar, Ujjain, and other sacred spots</li>
<li>had Euclid&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elements of Geometry&rdquo; translated into Sanskrit as also several works on trigonometry, and Napier&rsquo;s work on the construction and use of logarithms</li>
<li>&ldquo;at some point he ceased issuing bilingual, i.e., Rajasthani and Persian, deeds and by 1712 was using only a form of Dhundari, the local dialect of Rajasthani, for such documents (Horstmann 1999a, 49).&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;He had also stopped using the Persian calendar, using instead the Vikram dating system.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;In 1716, he ceased paying tribute to the emperor on his official seal, a tradition that went back many generations, and began to pay tribute to his own father, Bishan Singh. Later, in 1727, the seal was dedicated to the deity Sri Sitaramji.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;On a more personal note, he refrained from formally or publicly using the
title “Mirza Raja&rdquo;, which had been conferred in 1712 by both Jahandar Shah and
Farrukhsiyar. Perhaps he simply preferred the title “Sawai”&rdquo;</li>
