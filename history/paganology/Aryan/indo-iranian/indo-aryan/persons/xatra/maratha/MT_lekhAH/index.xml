      <description>“Brahmins do not have it in them to fight” was a common refrain I had heard despite being brought up on the tales of the bhR^igu conquests of yore- r^ichIka, jamadagni, rAma, agni aurva and all of them. I had almost internalized it. But my conversations with PR got me thinking about it from different angles till I discovered the truth. My learned AchArya had a peculiar regard for PR: he would regularly come to recite the R^ig veda when he taught it and would only talk with our AchArya in Sanskrit.</description>

      <description>This remarkable issue was brought to my attention by a person who specifically wishes to remain un-named on these pages on account of certain private reasons related to this narrative. It is clear that Shahji was a rather distinguished military leader and he had transmitted this genetically influenced trait to not only his famous son Shivaji, but also the forgotten elder son Sambhaji.
In reality he also passed these genes on to another son who has been largely forgotten in modern Maharatta histories.</description>

      <description>An important lesson is there to be learnt from what happened between 1795 to 1818 vis-a-vis the Maharattas. Bajirao II handed himself up to British protection as he was in conflict with Daulatrao Shinde. Shinde was in turn in locked in enemity with Yashvant and Vithoji Holkar and the other major Maharatta chiefs like Gaikwad in Gujarat and Bhosle of Nagpur. Vithoji Holkar was given to banditry and he began large scale thievery and raiding along with his Pendharis north of the Krishna river.</description>

      <description>The muni and me stood on the elevated wall of the plinth of the shanivAr palace (Shaniwar palace) on a blazing Indian afternoon about an year ago. That was all that was left of the palace built by the famed Peshwa, who had raised the Maharattas to their greatest glory. The Peshva was a Brahmin of the coastal community different from the interior brahmins of Maharashtra. Some have believed that these Brahmins had origins elsewhere in North India, but genetically they are not very different from other “pa~ncha-draviDa” brahmin groups.</description>

      <description>When Sambhaji seized power he invited his father’s advisor the bhakti saint Ramadas to meet him. However, Ramadas displeased by Sambhaji’s brutalities that accompanied his accession refused to meet him. His disciples however begged on him to advice the prince. Accordingly he sent him the following letter:
“Always be on guard and never lower you guard. Control your temper and be good and kind towards others. Forgive your subjects for their faults and bind them to your person by making them happy.</description>

      <description>In my childhood I was quite disappointed with our history books not providing any details what so ever, beyond even the merest mention, about the life and role of Sambhaji the brother of the founder of the Maharatta nation. So for long I wished to write a brief history Sambhaji, the brother of Shivaji, his contributions to the Hindu struggle and his early death on the battlefield. What ever we know of his struggle is mainly from Sanskrit chronicles like those of Paramanand and Jayaram Pandit (Maharatta Brahmin historians and contemporaries), supplemented by bakars and Farmans of the Mohammedans.</description>

      <description>Mustafa Khan’s invasions
Shah Jahan called on Adil Shah and Qutb Shah to destroy the Hindus of the South and bring the whole of Hind under Islam. First, Mustafa Khan attacked the Vijayanagaran army lead by the Nayaka Shivappa who had liberated Ikkeri (1645). The Hindus fought with great fury and inflicted severe losses on the Moslems in the battle of Sagar. But Mustafa Khan who greatly hated the Hindus was strengthened by reserves and he fell back on Shivappa Nayaka, routing him in the second battle of Ikkeri.</description>

      <description>Sambhaji and Shivaji break free
Following Shahji’s arrest his sons Sambhaji in Banglore and Shivaji in Pune started asserting their independence against the Moslems. With the help of the Brahmin advisers they started acting as independent *Hindu* rulers and did not remit any tributes to the Adil Shah. The Sultan acted quickly and sent a force under Asad Khan from Jinji to take Bangalore from Sambhaji. Sambhaji gave a notable display of his valor by routing the Moslem force advancing towards Banglore by after intercepting it on the way to the city.</description>

In a whirl wind campaign Awrangzeeb had conquered the Adil Shahi kingdom, founded by the prince Adil Khan the brother of the Ottoman sultan Mehmet II Fathi of Turkey and the Qutb Shahi kingdom which was bravely defended to the very end by the Turk, Abdur Razzak.</description>

      <description>After the death of Hambirrao Mohite, the Mogol armies pressed hard on the Maharattas forcing them to the strongest fortresses in Sahayadris for shelter. Awrangzeeb’s army was struck by bubonic plague, but he continued moving his vast divisions westwards to encircle the Maharattas. He also sent a division towards Bangalore and Tamil Nad to cut out the southern base of the Marathas. Sambhaji, without his ace general was entirely in the control of his base Kanyakubja Brahmin minister Kalash.</description>

      <description>Intro The problem of the origin of the royal Bhosles, or the clan of Shivaji the reviver of Hindu fortunes, has interested me at various points due to a variety of reasons. I had come across the notorious stone inscription in Thanjavur that gave a peculiar genealogy that did not match any other genealogy from Maharashtra.
shUdra → kShatriya During my peregrinations in the Maharatta country I came across tribal Bhosles who were cattle-herders, and many other tribal groups bearing traditionally Maharatta last names- e.</description>

      <description>Very little has been recorded of the valiant freedom struggle in the Konkan in the horror years of Indian history. The Konkans on the west coast of India had long been the bastion of the Indic civilization that withstood external attacks due to the protective influence of the Western Ghats. The first major wave of Islamic onslaughts on the region was initiated by Alla-ad-din Khalji when he dispatched his ace commander Maliq Kaffr to wage Jihad on the ancient dynasty of the Kadambas, who were the principal rulers of the Konkans.</description>
