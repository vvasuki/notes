Vedic regard In the Rgveda the gotama-s repeatedly and respectfully mention the bhRgu-s as the founders of the fire rite, which is consonant with their position at the head of the shrauta gotra-pravara lists.
For example:
 dadhuSh TvA bhRgavo mAnuSheShvA rayiM na chAruM suhavaM janebhyaH |
hotAram agne atithiM vareNyaM mitraM na shevaM divyAya janmane ||RV 1.58.6
 Here nodhA gautama declares that the bhRgu-s first established the ritual fire in the midst of men.</description>

The imprint of the bhRgu-s is not just all over the literature of bhAratavarSha but also dotting the very expanses of the land of the bhArata-s. While being a bhRgu, I may be biased to see this imprint more than others, the fact has been observed by many others. The following is a purely parochial view of history seen through the lens of my ancestry, yet I believe there are elements of real significance for the history of the Hindu nation.</description>

      <description>datta, the atri, was endowed with lasting youthfulness and was the embodiment of all the 3 guNas. In his early life was a great warrior and was the prime minister and priest of haihaya emperor, kArtavIrya arjuna. He led the haihaya troops to many great victories and participated in the rise of the emperor. The haihaya king was un-paralleled in the use of arms and having conquered the entire known world was crowned as saMrAT by dattAtreya.</description>

From the accounts of vedic tradition the bhRgu-s were the foremost of the RShi-s. It appears that they were the founders of the fire ritual which is at the heart of the vedic religion. They are not authors of many mantra-s of the Rg veda, though their surrogate clan, the shaunahotra-s, have a maNDala to themselves (RV2). Nevertheless, bhRgu or the bhRgu-s are mentioned 27 times by name in the RV.</description>
