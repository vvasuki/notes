      <description>MelpattUr nArAyaNa bhaTTathiri, was a great nambuthiri sanskrit writer who apparently lived for a 106 years (born 1560) after escaping death due to syphilis earlier in his life. He wrote a remarkable vaishNava tract, the nArAyaNIyaM, which is a glorious work of sanskrit poetry despite its extremist stance. prakriyA sarvasva was his famous treatise on saMskR^it grammar that took the place of the siddhAnta kaumudI of bhaTToji dIkShita in the midst of the nambuthiris.</description>
