      <description>गोत्र-प्रवर-विचारः Summary  As late as the 11th c. AD, in the Gotra-Pravara-Manjari of Purusottama-Pandita, it is written as still prevalent that the gotra-pravara system applies to brahman (arsheya) lineages only: the Baudhayana-Pravara-Adhyaya mentions that the (biological) descendants of the seven rishis plus Agastya as the eighth are called gotra: this is the arsha-gotra (pita-putra parampara).
The conventional sense is used as laukika-gotra (guru-shishya parampara/which non-brahmans use). Over the centuries, during to social and cultural changes, various groups in India have adopted the gotra system, but the pravara system still applies only to brahman gotras.</description>
