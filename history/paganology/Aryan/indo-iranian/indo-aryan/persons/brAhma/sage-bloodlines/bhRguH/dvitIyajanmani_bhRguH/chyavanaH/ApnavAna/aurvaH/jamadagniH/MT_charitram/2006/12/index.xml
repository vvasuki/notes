      <description>The eldest son of the great king of Nepal, pR^ithivi nArAyaNa shahA (who defeated the British and founded the Nepal Kingdom until its recent destruction by Marxists), pratApa siMha, compiled a voluminous work on the mantra shAstra during his brief life. As a companion to this a collection of pictures for the dhyAna-s on various deities was prepared by the artists in Nepal. A copy of this collection with R1’s father is of considerable interest in terms of tradition Hindu dhyAna art of which not many old samples survive.</description>

      <description>We set out on an utterly free afternoon on a long and interesting drive towards the place known as the Sahayadri. We passed by Mis-creant’s house but resisted the temptation to call on her, then we passed the hilly outcrops where the rough rowdy lived, and arrived at the spot where the muni’s horse had fallen as he was fleeing the black dasyus of viTmaru. Then we arrived at Sujata’s house.</description>
