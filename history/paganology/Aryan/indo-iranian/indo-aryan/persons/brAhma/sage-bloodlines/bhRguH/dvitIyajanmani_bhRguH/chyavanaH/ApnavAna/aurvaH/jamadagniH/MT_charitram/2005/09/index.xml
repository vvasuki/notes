      <description>Hayastanika is known as sarvapriyA and mahAsurApipAnA. Thus, we mused over the turn of the chakra known as the saMvatsara. The wheel turned and sharadaH had come resulting in the dismal air that hangs over us. We decided to stay away from lalAmI and enjoy the pleasant company of Kappa, which was like a madhu-chaShaka in itself. We saw the movie sukhAvati of Campbell and then began discussing a hero with a 1000 faces.</description>

      <description>Today I was at the Philadelphia museum- a few childhood dreams of mine were finally fulfilled. I got an opportunity to examine the following skulls and skeletons at some length:
1) The skull Eoraptor
2) The skull of Hererrasaurus
both of which are amongst the earliest theropods.
The skeletons of
3) Dromeosaurus and
4) Saurornithoides,
two deinonychosaurs close to the origins of birds
5) The second skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex (this specimen has a better preserved fore limb that allowed me study carpal and ungual morphology)</description>

      <description>The chance for the kuriltai was unusually solidified by the bold Argentinian adventurer. At the said hour we met with Mn and the shachiva’s prime agent. Mn, was a pioneer and even bolder adventurer than the Argentinian and was as ever silent, but he was shaken the strikes close to home. The shachiva’s agent who had maintained silence all this while, suddenly gave in to revealing the secrets of Jx. We were surprised the precision with which the shachiva’s agent described the various issues surrounding the rAkShasi.</description>
