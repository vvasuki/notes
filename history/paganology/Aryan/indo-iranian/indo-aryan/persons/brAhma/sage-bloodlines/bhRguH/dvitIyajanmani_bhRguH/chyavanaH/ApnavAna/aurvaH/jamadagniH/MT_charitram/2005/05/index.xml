      <description>The last step had been reached. The powers of the mAnava had reached their end. Only the powers of the devas were next recourse. It is also called the setu- the bridge to the unknown loka. We had reached the end of the bridge- we stood at the door stead of the loka hidden beyond the impenetrable veil. Many fragments of thoughts crowded the brain- each having its own significance to us- we record them here for we are passing out that path, which the mAnava takes only once in his existence.</description>

      <description>“svargeNa svargaM”
There were two cell phones. One of mine and one of Jx. They were both mundane objects. There were numerous cell phones like that in the market. The one Jx possessed was very sleekly designed and was easy to use. The one I possessed was one which Jx coveted but I found very difficult to use. The Mumbai hecklers asked us: After all your mantra and tantra did your arcane gods only give you this cell phone?</description>
