      <description>For some reason I used the word cynosure. The muni and I had a brief discussion on this word some time ago. It appears the the word cynosure is from the name tail of Canis Major (cynos-ura). This construct seems to be an archaic Indo-European word because we encounter a similar set of words as the names of the sons of the fallen bhArgava ajigarta. The most famous of them was the bhArgava R^iShi shunaHshepa Ajigarti who later became devarAta vaishvAmitra.</description>

      <description>The harsh cawing of the solitary crow at night announces her presence. Of large size with dishevelled hair she roams. The severed heads of viShNu and rudra are seen beside her. The mystic bIja graaaM is reverberating all around her. There are the senAs of the lulApamukhas around her commanded by the dreaded kAlavAhanavadana. Beside her sits her fair daughter rakta-jyeShThA or upa-dhUmrA. Her pArshadhas are yelling hideous statements like without shivA, shiva is but a shava.</description>

      <description>A friend, in course of a yarning session, reminded me of the days of bhoga. In a social situation with Marc, R and Hayastanika we were all ganging to make fun of R. A person, who shall go un-named, remarked in full auditory range of Marc that, if R is around, people stop paying attention everyone else but her. This statement by that person could have caused me enormous social damage in an as-it-is tense situation.</description>

      <title>The Liberation of Jx</title>

      <description>The clansmen got to gether to take stock of the proceedings. The case of Jx was remarkable. He had been pinned down by the attack of the vairi-s who were deluding him. He finally woke up on that fateful Monday morning. His purohita pressed home with the fierce attack that hurled arrows like a hail on the attack. His vairi-s were completely gone. They were gone like the sky blown clean of all the clouds to reveal the azure heights, with nothing but the midday sun blazing on the cobalt vault.</description>

      <description>We walked up the path of the hill of the vAnara, when the dasyus were not its rulers yet. There was a glorious cleft on the side of the hillock, which led to a deep valley with wonderfully eroded paths. There a cool breeze often blew and we wandered around with the muni, kumbhodbhavA, and occasionally kR^iShNavarNa and the rAmAnujavAdin. The muni and myself had installed a installed a large li~Nga there for the worship of The god in the cleft and worshipped it with the brAhmi plant and the sha~Nka puShpa.</description>
