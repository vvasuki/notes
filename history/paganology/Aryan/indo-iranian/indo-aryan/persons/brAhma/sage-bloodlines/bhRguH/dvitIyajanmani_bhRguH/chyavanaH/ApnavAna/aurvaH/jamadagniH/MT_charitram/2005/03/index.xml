      <description>We had earlier narrated how we had spent time in svarga with the apsaras. From there we descended to the himaparvatas- i.e for warm weather souls like us the slopes of the pAshaNDa’s hill. We continued sporting there for sometime enjoying the brief bliss of our successes. Then our ill fate brought us crashing to a low hollow in plane of pR^ithivi. We thought we had hit the nadir of existence when we were shaking from our thunderous crash to pR^ithivi.</description>

      <description>The critical time for khANDavaprastha had come. We were seeing signs of revolt. We deployed the dual saMGNYAnaM and kAmaM. We heavily rely on that. It had temporarily veiled the other party. But the true effects we will have to wait and see. We also need to spend a few days doing tarpaNaM to strI on laukIka matters (I wonder why women are so exaggerated in their mundane laukIka interests). Like the wandering yogI needing to please the gR^ihastrI or more precisely agastya maitrAvaruNi needing to pacify lopAmudra vaidharbhi.</description>

      <description>sha~Nkara bhagavatpAda had defeated the famous tantric navagupta of the pITha of kAmarUpa in a debate. navagupta unable to come to terms with his defeat invoked chAmuNDA with oblations of twigs dipped in menstrual blood and the sUtaka fluid. And thus he laid a spell on sha~Nkara. The unerring abhichAra of the great goddess had its effect on the Acharya and he was afflicted by a terrible sore in his ass.</description>

      <description>Since the Atman, which merely watches, is poised to cast away its sharIra and the old corpses shall lie on the path of no return, as though marked by the dance of sharva, we shall narrate those old events that we shall probably never get to talk of, once we walk ahead on the path. The tale of the yogi prince of Shri Lanka who was offered putrid food by the Dakini in the house of pleasure in bhArata came to our mind.</description>

      <description>We saw the wonderous charms of Hayastanika fade behind the impenetrable veils. We conjured memories of eating the wonderous superhot mango pickle on a pleasant spring afternoon and talking of the “pancha-shara mulapadhArta” with the wonderful Kappa on the wonderful summer day in the high mountains – they were both similar. We were reminded of the distant afternoon of the “curtain” where we experienced the pleasures of R’s company. Our reverie, as the pleasures of existence, was broken by the call from Jx.</description>
