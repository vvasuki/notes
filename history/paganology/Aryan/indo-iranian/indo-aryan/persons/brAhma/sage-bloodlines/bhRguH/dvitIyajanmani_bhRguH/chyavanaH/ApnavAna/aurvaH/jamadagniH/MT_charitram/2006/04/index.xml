      <description>The shachIva and and the amAtya gave us the signals that three kR^ityA’s were dispatched. The strong PM, main victim of Fourier, seemed to be under what might be his final decline. The dUtas of mahiShavAhana were apparently approaching him. The muni confirmed this possibility. He had lived his life of yoga and his mahAjapa of the shatarudriya, and devotion to the vedas had given him the first 2 year respite when he was first struck by the vairiprayogas.</description>

      <title>After the pAShaNDa hill</title>

      <description>We were trying to trace back the footsteps of besieger. We realized some of the details of what happened immediately after the pAShaNDa hill. We got out of pAShaNDa hill and were confronted by the second “born of soma”. We brushed aside “born of soma-2” pretty easily. Shortly there after an incantation followed. We believed that out pitA had taken care of that, but it was only partly so. Shaken by the recent turn of events for the first time he told us that there might have been a mistake at that point and that he might acted on a mistaken track for a whole year.</description>

      <description>The kR^ityA had hit precisely an year back. We knew that the anniversary strike was in the making. Around 2.30 PM the kR^ityA was seen again; as before, it rapidly breached all the kavachas and burnt its way through. It was like the classical pratya~Ngirasa kR^ityA described in the literature. The “Ajya tarpaNaM” held it off temporarily. We were reviewing the indra jAla 2 front with our general when she struck again.</description>

      <description>From the top of the fort, from the window we watched the desolate landscape cloaked in the moist haze of indra sprinklings. The last cry of the bird had been heard for the day. The amAtya and the shachiva were caught in their own troubles due the passing of the vR^iddha. On the shore Jx sat still unable to come to terms with the fact that he was free. His mantri-s were also caught in the same troubles as our mantri-s.</description>

      <description>The best remembered of our expeditions were those to the city of bhairava, the fort of tridents and the long-winded peregrinations through the Maharatta countryside.In the halcyon days Mis-creant, muscleman S, his shUdra sycophant (shUdra shreShTha=SS) and me were seated on our parked vehicles and yarning in the vicinity of a little shrine of a medieaval devotional vaiShNava cult descending from the mahAnabhav cult. There were some devotional singers doling out the tune of a medieaval saint of the Maharatta country, whose song roughly translated thus: “Our pANDuraNGa is not like the goddess jAkhAI, jokhAI, mAyArANI or mhaisAbAI.</description>

      <description>Anandavardhana was a remarkable figure. In my Sanskrit learning I gave him the skip because the theory and practice of alaMkAra never struck a chord in me in my youth (I also had a great excuse). My mother spoke of a lot of theory and practice of alaMkAra literature but I realized soon that her way of conveying it was not at all for me. In any case my then AchArya found my excuse convincing and maintained that we could continue with analysis of the yajur vedic prose when I returned.</description>
