      <description>We moved up the hill rapidly (remember the hill which came in the dreams!). It was the brief pleasure sent by the gods. It was like that, which had visited the four kings, namely divodAsa, uShinAra, vishvAmitra etc in the form of yayAti’s daughter mAdhavi. But it was the shorter and wholly empty unlike that briefly enjoyed by those great kshatriyas of yore. Coursing freely in a rapid ratha we reached the paravata.</description>

      <description>Some years ago R and me were lying on the grass following our quarry, a goodly specimen of Menemerus, that kept saltating in search of its quarry. Then our eyes caught sight of a Salticus specimen that was capturing a small earwig and we kept following it to observe the process. R then moved on to a Marpissa mucosa, while I drifted away towards a gorgeous Icius. At the that point for some reason we paused.</description>
