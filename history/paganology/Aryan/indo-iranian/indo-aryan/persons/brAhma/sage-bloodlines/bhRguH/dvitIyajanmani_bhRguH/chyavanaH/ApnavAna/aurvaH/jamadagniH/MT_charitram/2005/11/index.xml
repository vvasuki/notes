      <description>Long after the cell phone had exploded violently we lay unable to make sense of what happened in the daze of the blast. We then saw that figure moving like dhumAvati. It was laughing loudly and had all manifestations of alakShmi. We longed for the lengthy conversations with the muni. We marched through beaten path of the evil turuShka sultan with the low sun beating down upon. Having reached an appropriate bend we made our offerings of savitar and varuNa.</description>

      <description>“Everyone knows well how the bharadvAja yavakri met his end due the kAshyapa’s spells.”
We had fallen back from suvargaM lokaM. We then started walking along the great path, when we saw a ratha similar to that of our ally of utkIla’s clan. We turned around to see the ratha, when we sensed someone was coming in front of us. We turned and were surprised to see a beautiful woman, dressed very formally.</description>

      <description>We had assembled for the gathering- me, durmukha, maireyapayin, mUlApasmara, vAta vyAdi, mlechCha sundarI, kavargA, harir-bArava all sahakuTumba. Glad to have escaped the tIkShNa hima we settled down to reel out the yarns. The conversation drifted to the journey that we had made with kalashajA to the hills in central India, where apparently bhasmasura had placed his hand on his head. kalashajA’s mother had provided us with the contact of a pious brAhmaNa woman who was civil servant in those regions held by the Dravidian tribes.</description>
