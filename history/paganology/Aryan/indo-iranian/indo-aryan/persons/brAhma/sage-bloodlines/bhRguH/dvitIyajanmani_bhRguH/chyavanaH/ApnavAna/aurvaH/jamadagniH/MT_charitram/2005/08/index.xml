      <description>The amAtya had warned us that we would face a mAraNa strike anytime. Sensing trouble we deployed the arrows of sharva around us. The archers surrounded us completely to shield us from the kR^ityA which was to strike. We were coursing in the grip of the kR^ityA, without much apparent effect. But suddenly the ratha in which we travelled was smashed completely. We were glad that the archers had kept us alive and we escaped with life, though our ratha was completely smashed.</description>

      <description>We were set to return to the same battlefield where we had last year fought one of the most disastrous battles of our existence. This battlefield was worse than the pAShaNDa hill: there we had lost out right, but here we had won the battle and the booty we took home was poisoned. It gave us no pleasure to go there but we had to do our part in the larger struggle.</description>

      <description>We sat on the edge of the crater of sorrow, defeat and destruction, which was much like the crater of a great volcano, with the inferal interiors obscured by pumice and granite. We saw many yakShIs, apsaras, pishAchis and rAkShasis pass by in silence. We were haunted by the memories of the fierce battle at the pAShaNDa hill in our native land in 2003. It was a demon-haunted world into which we had slipped after that battle.</description>

      <description>We paused for a moment looking out from our high perch into the foggy haze of the air around us. The joys of the world it appeared had deserted us. The devas had sent the brief respite, but it was all over. Why are we here we asked ourselves ?
Our mind raced back to the days of war between October-December of the year 2004. It was a fairly decisive period, but little did we know what the seizure of khANDAva had in store for us.</description>

      <description>We circumambulated the large lake at the base of Mount Kearsarge with mlechCha adventurer M. We were separated from the bandhas of samsAra at that point. We saw the old va~nga chieftain at the end of it. The va~nga had battled our old foe for a long time and outwitted him much as we had. He enquired about R1, R2, R3, K1, K2 and S. These brought very painful memories to our mind.</description>

      <description>GK had been a rival of R. R had genuine knowledge, but GK merely absorbed everything she read without much analysis or understanding. Otherwise they were quite equally matched. GK oozed arrogance, but R emanated genuine mental superiority over most. GK always had the ethnic advantage in both the lokas, but R was in the “foreigners” category. Still R was victorious over GK till the fourth year, after which she departed for the quest of “higher glory”.</description>
