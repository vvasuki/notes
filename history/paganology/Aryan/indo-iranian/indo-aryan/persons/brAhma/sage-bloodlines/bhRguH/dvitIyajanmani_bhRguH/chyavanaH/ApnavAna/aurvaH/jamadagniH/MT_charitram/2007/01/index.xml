      <description>We had the dUradR^iShTi about the movements of the khANDavan vairi-s. We knew precisely how they were going to strike. So we waited patiently and as we knew that they had two prayogas against us and where the abhichAra was going to be placed. We saw the first graha coming and were for a while caught in its stambhana. Then the great rudra came to our aid when we made the 8-fold oblations and neutralized it.</description>

      <description>On the path of nothingness we returned;
before us stood the bright prajApati,
with rudra’s bright dart pinning him to the welkin.
In one hand we held an iron trident,
in the other we held a skull.
Beyond the carcass of prajapati
shone his wain, with the ruddy gem in it struck.
Further ahead shone the six mothers,
of our patron god with the spear.
Around us stood the city’s denizens.</description>

      <description>She said: “We return to that halcyon year and a half. When the son of Brinda was toiling relentlessly, fueled by testosterone and goaded by his crafty, parents we set out the seek the truth. Beyond the row of 3 shUdras were two: one a shUdra and one a brAhmaNa.”
I said: “We return indeed to that time in our walk. We were free, like never before and never after.</description>
