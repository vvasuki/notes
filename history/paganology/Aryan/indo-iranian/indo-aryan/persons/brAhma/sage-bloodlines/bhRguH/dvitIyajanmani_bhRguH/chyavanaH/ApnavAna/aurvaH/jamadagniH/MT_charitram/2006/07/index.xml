      <description>bhR^igu, the founder of our race, had said that food was brahman. In that quest we set out to the city center. They say no journey in the company of a true friend is ever long. They say no wait in the company of a comely and amiable young woman is too long. But a journey in the company of a false friend or even the briefest wait in the company of a rAkShasi-like woman is a passage through naraka.</description>

      <description>We heard from Jx that through the sAdhana-s his preceptor had bestowed on him he had completely repulsed the abhichAra. He was finally relieved from the flight of the crane: it was confirmed, but it had taken a severe toll on him. Most ill-effects except one on which the vairi had invested the most had been reversed. MM was considerably relieved that her mantras had rescued him. We had seen how the the siddhi of kAtyAyanI had visited MM, and later the most hallowed skanda had also visited her, so we did not doubt her abilties at all.</description>
