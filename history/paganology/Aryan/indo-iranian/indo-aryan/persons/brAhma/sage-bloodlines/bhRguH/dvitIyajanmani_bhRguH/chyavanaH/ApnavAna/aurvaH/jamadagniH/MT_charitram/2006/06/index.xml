      <description>RM had a charismatic appearance and could present a himself as an intellectual. He was not a svayaM prakAsha but picked up knowledge from different generally reticent sources and presented to his circle of largely ignorant friends. He widely lectured to youngsters about the Hindu ways of mythology, philosophy, exercise and ritual performance.

      <description>The news reached us that rakShohA agni had cleared 3 of the vR^itra and nirR^iti had gone back her way. We thought the clouds were clearing. But Fourier’s man, who was feared as shUravarman, got the news too. Never had he been intimidated thus or his men faced such uchChATana-s. He accordingly released the deadly “crane arrow”. Never was balance between life and death so clear.
Past mid-night we faced the terror of the crane.</description>

      <description>While we were still being relentless hammered by the shiva-yuvatI of mahArudra, we decided to attend to the long-standing battle where the young yoddha was faltering. It was the glorious quest of what was code-named: “ghR^itagaNa cha dvyAmlaka”, a high prize that I had earned for since my earliest days in the senAmukha, in the halcyon teens, filled with youthful intemperance.
