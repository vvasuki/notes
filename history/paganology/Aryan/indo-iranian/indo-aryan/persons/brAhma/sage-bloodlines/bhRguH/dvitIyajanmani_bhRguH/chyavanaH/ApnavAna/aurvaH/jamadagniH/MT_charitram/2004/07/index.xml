      <description>“Burg Niedeck ist im Elsass der Sage wohlbekannt. Die Höhe, wo vorzeiten die Burg der Riesen stand.”-Adelbert von Chamisso
I stood before the great vimalashambhu. The amR^ita flowed from the heaven cup of soma and drenched the great nityaklinnA on the 4th point of the yoni triangle. Raimented in the red, her limbs were smeared with red unguent, she held a skull bowl filled with red wine. Her face was full of smiles and restless with desire.</description>

      <description>I received a call from him. He sounded much the same rustic fellow as I hand last enountered him over 8 years ago. His accent was the same rasping one, which sounded like a metal plate rubbing on another. I asked what had befallen him. He replied that he had been to the house beside the curve on the northward street and was quite sick after his stay there. I was shocked, that this could happen.</description>
