      <description>With almost an year passing since the Great Fall we reflect upon him who acquired “eko mAnuSha AnandaH” that is alluded to in the texts. He lived once upon a time beside the swamp with snakes and crocodilians in it. He was of immense intelligence and physical abilities, and he was capable of performing complex rites. He was set on the path of knowing the truth. He was recognized for his speed and agility and was recruited amongst the able ones.</description>

      <description>What ever happened after we passed on to the other side of the guillotine we were not sure. Evidentally at that point we did not know if the guillotine had fallen or not. In reality the English encounter was the begining of the troubles. We got past the deployer of the ghora dUradR^iShTi vidyA and were resting silently. We then wandered on the Deccan plains in the year 2002, when are our armies were still unstoppable, and had a brief wandering with the muni who was declining towards the abyss.</description>
