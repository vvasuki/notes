There arose a yakShI from the fervid flames, whom we shall call OPJ. This yakShI had all the guNas we had concieved in the sujAtA-rUpa. We passed the torturous Dismal Hollows Road and a little shmashAna lay beyond it. There from the hollow of an old kapala in which the offering was being made beyond the midnight hour the remarkable yakShI arose.</description>

      <description>We flew up again with the yakShini. There we stood in the mid-welkin and bewitching yakShini whispered in my ear:
“We need to talk about about a profound question”.
Me: What is it?
Y: Of all those sexually reproducing beings out there, the majority of them are heterogamous There are some like Chlamydomonas that produce similar-looking gametes- the male and female gametes are the same. But the majority of cases have converged on clear anisogamy or heterogamy.</description>

      <description>The paths of the yakShiNi 

After having been pursued relentlessly by the kR^ityA sent against us we reached the place known as the Dismal Hollows. There we entered The House and called up the yakShiNi again. She came forth even as agni had shot up when praised by the hymns of the long gone fathers, bhR^igu, ushana kAvya, apanavAna and aurva. She created that shield that kept of the kR^ityA from coming through.</description>
