      <description>We wandered on the path by day and decided that we should wander in the pitch darkness of night. We set out slowly wending our way through the paths. We agreed that either of us would not have done on our own. midway there was the four-cross. We sat on the stones there in the middle. The black figure of Dollolas suddenly emerged from the thickets. I see the past and future with my disc, said the foremost of the nishAdas.</description>

      <description>It was a sombre afternoon in the year after dashAnta when Blackie and I were wedged in a convenient cleft in the wall that separated the two grounds, watching a 3rd rate cricket match played by two second division teams. Somehow my mind was not in the match at all for there was hardly anything to commend itself in the bowling or batting; nevertheless it was better than sitting through the drone of a botany lecture.</description>

      <description>Never before had I descended to such a low, especially given all the show I had made. It was like Tendulkar scoring two zeroes in a row. All around us were atirathis and mahArathis (mark that word for it is indeed a pun) but still I was a mahArathi too, who had taken on the intense heat of battle. Pricked quick by the defeats I had faced, but confident about my abilities, I made a charge, even as Prataprao had done in the fateful battle of Ahmednagar, and blew away our rival mahArathis in a battle that knew no bounds in its fury.</description>

      <description>I received a call from him. He sounded much the same rustic fellow as I hand last enountered him over 8 years ago. His accent was the same rasping one, which sounded like a metal plate rubbing on another. I asked what had befallen him. He replied that he had been to the house beside the curve on the northward street and was quite sick after his stay there. I was shocked, that this could happen.</description>
