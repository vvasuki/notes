      <description>We saw that front #3 was a grand success in yesterday’s hostilities. We first blunted the attack by raising the water in the moat and causing the enemy troops to retreat. Then we used the naphta trick that we discovered after a terrible defeat a few winters ago. Invoking deva savitA and taking our time to launch counter-offensive we went heavy on naptha again today. The hostile forces suffered heavy losses and retreated in disarray.</description>

      <description>As we have a long day ahead of us tommorow we shall be curt. We did surprisingly well on front #3 and we hope the gods favor us again in a similar encounter tommorow. We also obtained some clue regarding our ranking in the midst of the warring states. We believe we were evenly matched with our adversary. But as every one knows battles can be lost on small points. Certain unusual delays that our rivals were subject to favored us on the front.</description>

      <description>The enemy forces did not strike on front #1 as we had expected. Our spies inform us that they have decided to instead pause futher hostilities on front #1 and instead resort to the Trojan horse strategy. In our “Gaugamela”, which was in a month of blazing heat we had fallen prey to that strategy and lost terribly. We, however, learnt our lesson, even if it came at a high cost.</description>

      <description>In the year of dvAdashAnta, MP found every neuron in his brain captured by R. I believe every waking and perhaps non-waking hour of the day he was only occupied by R. In the company of other males he spoke only of R and how he may impress her. On what he thought to be the day of reckoning, our duhitaram kalashaja non-chalantly asked MP whether some eight-carbon ring with alternating double bonds will be an acid or a base.</description>

      <description>We had beaten back the fierce thrust launched by our foes on our fort. We knew that we could fend off their assault as long as we held the fort. However, on realistically assessing the situation we realized that this hardly meant that we had won the war. We had been greatly weakened by the several years of constant war on the frontiers. For an empire to remain in good health a lot actually depends on the internal conditions.</description>

      <description>Our sachIva had proposed a long and intricate escape plan that had promising aspects to it. It needed a particular maneuver that was difficult but could be achieved with the help of my greatest ally. I had started considering it seriously as an option in the event we face a defeat on the front #3. However, I suddenly realized that this escape route could very well turn out the route for exit from this earth.</description>

      <description>We completed the fortifications on various crags and they stood reasonably. Shortly after we had done so the hostile forces opened a massive assault on front #3. Our fortifications fended the attack, but were severely tested. We then strengthened some further outposts, and called off all diplomats. Then, tired as never before, we retired to rest. After that we went to inspect one of the fortifications, when a massive hostile thrust occurred on front #1.</description>

      <description>I was standing alone in the railway station in the bleak winter air. There was not a single sound and the air hung eerily as though weighed down by the cold. Suddenly the air quivered with the fluttering of a pigeon’s wings as it made its roostward retreat and then there was silence again- the shakuna! The sun sunk on the pashchima mayukha, leaving behind the gloaming and the azure depths of dyaus turned inky dark.</description>

      <description>We repulsed another attack on our position by the brigade from dundubhidurga. Seeing that dundudbhidurga was strategically placed to fire rockets at us, we decided to use the confusion of our foe to take the fort. I set out with a force of commandos and attacked dundubhidurga. We detonated a part of the wall an got in. We face some opposition but as our men had taken the commanding heights we were able to kill the defenders.</description>

      <description>Many seeds greatly fascinated me when I was young (actually they continue to do so) . One of these was the rosary pea (Abrus precatorius). The other was the castor seed. When we had beheld the all-bewitching Kappa Hayastanika, like most other mortals, we had uttered the words:

“aho rUpaM aho dhAma aho asyA navaM vayaH / ka~Nja-palAshAkShi vAmoru mathnatIva manAMsi naH /tvaM asi sharIriNAM sarvendriya-manaH-prItiM // “</description>

      <description>Our spies provided us with speculative intelligence that the hostile forces may be preparing a trap for us. However, we were not able to confirm it based on other reports. The princess of Hayastan, with calves like the quivers of kAma, gave us one of those Mona Lisa smiles and drove away on her ratha. As ever, if one meets her the right way one is transported to the shores of the ocean of bliss.</description>

      <description>Seeing that our foes had not fired the expected salvos, we were growing curious like the legendary cat. There was a heated discussion amongst our staff whether to counter-attack or lie and wait. While we had gained an advantage on front #3, a counter-attack could prove costly, as our resources had run out. Towards night I could not bear the wait and ordered a cautious counter-attack. The hostile forces behaved unusually.</description>

      <description>So will ich liegen und horchen still,
Wie eine Schildwach, im Grabe,
Bis einst ich höre Kanonengebrüll
Und wiehernder Rosse Getrabe.
Dann reitet mein Kaiser wohl über mein Grab,
Viel Schwerter klirren und blitzen;
Dann steig ich gewaffnet hervor aus dem Grab,
Den Kaiser, den Kaiser zu schützen.
Around midday we hear a huge explosion on the western ramparts. An enormous hostile horde was trying to make its way through the western wall.</description>
