      <description>We shall dialate upon the cell phone+digital camera sale saga when we get the chance later. But we must remark that we reached the last shop keeping cell phones at the end of a long and arduous trek. We did not find a phone cum camera contraption. But we bought the last cell phone that lay on the last shelf. We await our fate there after.</description>

      <description>Mr. Engineer of Mangalagrama (We shall call him Fourier after his fascination for illustrating Fourier transforms) had become a vairi of our clansmen on account of his daughter. His friend had controlled the bhuta that the board had and gave it to Fourier. He laid many an incantation on some our clansmen. J, was seized and broken up by his charms. J’ mother was harrassed immensely by one of those spells.</description>

      <description>There were the two players of Tetris who were known as Wump and Tump. They Wump and Tump were good each playing at their respective level. But obviously one was better than the other. My strI finally gave me a hint of which level I was at. I feared I was the worst of the pack but in the least there were others worse than me. So assuming that my kAmikA was right, may be I do play at a reasonable level.</description>

      <description>Those battles were over. Our gaping breaches in the fronts of sharirasya oShadhi, dagdaratha and kosha remained, but the realization dawned on us that we had won the encounter. Our amAtya and sachIva had been unfortunately cursed with naraka which had visited then in the form of the dreadful possession of the old one. indra had however given them a boon that they would pass through naraka in pleasant surroundings. We had invested the fort of khANDavaprastha after much fighting.</description>

      <title>pratya~NgirA and kR^ityA prayoga</title>

      <description>There was more than one discussion recently as to whether the tantric goddess pratya~NgirA was associated with a kR^ityA prayoga. The atharvan text clearly deploys the sUkta of pratichIna A~Ngirasa as a counter charm against kR^ityAs. An extension of the deployment, similar in spirit is seen in the R^ig vidhAna of shaunaka. MS Bhat titled his study on the R^igvidhAna as “Vedic Tantrism”. This title is somewhat appropriate because the vidhAna appears to represent intermediate condition through which the evolution of vedic prayogas into tantric prayogas occured.</description>

      <description>Jx had procured himself a cell phone. After some time somAkhya had also purchased a cell phone. Jx had all kinds of problems with his phone. Everyone who would look at Jx’s phone would say: “Wow that is a great phone.” All features we want is there in it they would say. But Jx would shake his head and say it just does not work. They would take his phone and place a call and ask their friends to call back and they all felt it worked fine.</description>
