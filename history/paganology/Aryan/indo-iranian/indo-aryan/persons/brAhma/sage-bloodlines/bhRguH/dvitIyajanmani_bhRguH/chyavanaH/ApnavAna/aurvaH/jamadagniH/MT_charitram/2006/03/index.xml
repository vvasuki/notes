      <description>A number of idols have been routinely used by my family in various upAsanas. A few are detailed below:

The rudra family: The wooden kumAra on the left is our patron deity, the deity of the clan and the protector deity. The idol is routinely installed on the trienniel skanda yAga performed as per the atharvaNa krama ordained by gopatha. The central idol is the bronze idol of uma and rudra that has been worshiped for a long time now by my clansmen for various festivals and receives regular rudrArchana.</description>

      <description>chakra-nArAyaNa: The icon of viShNu combined with the sudarshana wheel. He is offered the combined tarpanaM of the ugraviShNu and the bahuchakra mantras.

This a replica of the idol housed in the Madhurai shrine, the city with which one of the lineages of mine is associated. Previously they were kept concealed except on the days of the special offerings.

The mother of heroes and the mother of gods.</description>

      <description>R told me that her amongst her chosen devatAs whose mantras are perfect with her is bagalAmukhI. Fourier of maNgalagrAma, was initiated into bagalAmukhI vidyAs by the powerful chera magician. bagalAmukhi deployments can be terrifying for the victim and there are many of them that are generally kept secret. Some bagalAmukhi deployment that I have come across include:
   the dhattUra haritAla lepana prayoga- the yellow orpinient made from a mixture of dhattUra bIja and turmeric which can used for stambhana and vashikaraNa.</description>

      <description>We had a discussion with K, ST and R about some web sites they were reading about obtaining the average facial type of a given population. They pointed me to a great free morphing software that did it- SQIRLZ MORPH. I decided to try my hand at creating the average Hindu young male face. I am not sure if this is really an average for nothing statistical has been done.</description>
