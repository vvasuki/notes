      <description>MelpattUr nArAyaNa bhaTTathiri, was a great nambuthiri sanskrit writer who apparently lived for a 106 years (born 1560) after escaping death due to syphilis earlier in his life. He wrote a remarkable vaishNava tract, the nArAyaNIyaM, which is a glorious work of sanskrit poetry despite its extremist stance. prakriyA sarvasva was his famous treatise on saMskR^it grammar that took the place of the siddhAnta kaumudI of bhaTToji dIkShita in the midst of the nambuthiris.</description>

His son Bajirao, and successor was the greatest luminary of this community who in his brief lifespan achieved success that nearly unmatched by any other Hindu general before him. The one other man of his jAti, who came close to his level of glory was Balgangadhar Tilak- the man who led India’s struggle against the Chrisitian tyrants from England.</description>
