      <description>In the two years of college I was a magnet for a knot of colorful losers, such Blackie, Vidrum, Dom and Damru.
One day R walked up to me and said : “It does not do your image any good to hang out with those guys”.
I asked: “In whose eyes do I need to have an image?”
R: “The class elite”.I: “Why so?” R: “If I were not to be ocassionally seen with you, then your image with the class elite will drop to an even lower abyss”</description>

      <description>It had been pouring heavily. Normally on such a day I would have not liked to step out of the warmth of the house and drive through the slush and the dampness of the Hindustani monsoon. But that was a strange day. There was this sense of adventure that seized me and I got on to my aging black “horse” and drove on till I reached the bike stand. Having parked and not minding the oppression caused by indra’s bounty I head straight to the classroom.</description>

      <description>“Those who want to know the real story will know it.”
Beyond the world of the Falcon, stationed in eternal time, were the great atharvans. udvanta AtharvaNa amongst them held a soma cup. He descended to the sattra of the 3 seers. He asked preNin the son of somAhita, madhucchandas the vaishvAmitra and asita the kAshyapa to make their wishes. preNin wished that he should have the best goat and that which ever woman he calls unto him should desire him.</description>

      <description>The smart and ever-scheming GS had been my student some years ago. He came from a sAma vedic family of bharadvAjas. His academic record had been a long string of successes, like the victories of Alexander of Macedon. I had lead him to a few glorious victories and he had paid me suitable dakShiNa for that. He put to good use what he learned from me as he landed one great job after another, making enormous fiduciary killings on the way.</description>
