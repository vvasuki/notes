      <description>While cleaning up, I found some old pictures R had drawn for me while in school. It brought me some nostalgia and with due permissions I scanned them to put them up. She drew much better later in life, but I was never able to get her to draw more like these again. It is sad that a great tapestry of the yogini-s, vArAhI, mantriNI, ashvAruDhA and kAmeshvarI, in their war march, that she drew with considerable detail seems to be lost now.</description>

      <description>This was her piece on the goddesses- it is a ‘combined’ vision, though the drawings are entirely hers. It was done during the most dreary of all lectures, the geography class, during which even DoM, DamAr, tuNDika, duShTa-durmukha and others fell asleep.

      <description>There we moved swiftly on our vAhana and placed it on the stalls. The two shUdra-s kR^iShNamukha and shUdra-shiromaNi met us at the ashvashAla where we kept our horses. One of the shUdra-s asked, O foreign brahmin, should we participate in a vigorous game of kandUka kR^iDa in the yonder kandukaprastha that lies beyond the nAga-bila and at the foot hills of the vAnara parvata. The other shUdra said: this place is blessed with many women who are the handiworks of manmatha, yet why is it we are cursed to wander in these uninteresting assemblages with nothing more of interest than the aforesaid kR^IDa.</description>

      <description>Fancying myself as the wandering vrAtya I wandered in the mAnuSha lokaH. I noticed many leaving images in the eye and then in the brain. At face value these images are useless, but who knows, they may be the well-springs of future thoughts on the great moha. I appreciate daNDin that jewel of the bR^ihatcharaNa-s because of the word “bhramati”. I wandered beside the river holding my kapAla given to silence observing all.</description>

      <description>kR^iShamukha and paraShumukha organized their attack at us with the deep hate and hope of overthrowing us for good– the mahochChATanaM. We were enveloped by the kR^ityA-s of dhUmAvatI that they had sent. Our senAnI had warned us well of what was approaching. We paused for a moment and decided that we must break up kR^iShamukha and paraShumukha as well as their spells as we had done to yUpa-shiras and matsya-pucCha-shiras in that great battle of dvAdasha.</description>

      <description>We had sought she who dwells in the midst of the kiri chakra. Our AchArya’s AchArya the one learned in the great atharvan lore with all its parishiShTha-s, kalpa-s brAhmaNa and upaniShads retired to live in the most picturesque land south of lATa pradesha, with forests largely inhabited by niShAda tribes. There on the banks of the Damanganga river he settled down with the forest providing him the quietude and oShadhI-s for his rites.</description>
