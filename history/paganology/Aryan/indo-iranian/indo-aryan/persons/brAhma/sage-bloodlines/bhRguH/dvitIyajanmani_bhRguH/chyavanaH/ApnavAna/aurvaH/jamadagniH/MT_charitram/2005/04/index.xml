      <description>We spent a lot of time in mirth with the whole assembly. The nice weather before the return of vR^itra gave a brief respite. We enjoyed it all- a good night of astronomy, a whole day of lolling around in the spring sunshine, talking about all and sundry. We lived in the present the worries of the past and the future, the dIrgha-jihvIs and their ilk were all forgotten as though they never were- as though erased by the intoxication of the mAdvIpAnas.</description>

      <title>The last stretch</title>

      <description>We stood at the last stretch of the passage. Hence, we wanted to comment on somethings as they represent our very last comments in this phase of existence. As we remarked before we do not know if we shall speak of the face of the pishAchI. As our previous comments here, they shall be in the saMdhyAbhASha with the same codes in place.
We marched to the edge of the great shmashAna.</description>

      <description>The great deva sanatkumAra, the son of the fiery agni, is always in the company of his two wives: the glorious biDAlAkShi and the wonderous sumukhI. The one who knows this rahasya and performs the invocation of sumukhI along with the great dhUrtasvamI will be favored by them. That glorious goddess sumukhI also called the great mahAmayUrI, engaged in amorous dalliance with the dhUrta, is described as sulabhAgati. In the midst of her yantra, the mate of kArttikeya is meditated as residing and invoked with the mighty mantra (in mantra shAstra code):</description>

      <description>The last wick of bhairavAnanda does not fall before one goes under the wheel. We saw Jx with the wheel spinning on his head. We asked him- hey Jx how did you get that wheel on your head. And lo behold, the wheel flew off his head and crashed on to mine.

It was like Holmes and Moriarty locked in that final encounter on the cliff in Switzerland. One of them had to die– which one of them will it be or may be both ?</description>

      <description>svastrI had gone to check the original hall for its temperature and reported that as she came out she saw tura~NgA. My ugrakAmI tried to ask tura~NgA what she was doing there but she ran away. svastrI tried to chase her but even the pumAn have never beaten tura~NgA. The muni knew this as me and the muni had one watched a long gone duShTa chase tura~NgA and failed. I was intensely agitated by the display of tura~NgA, but the young muni who had transcended the rasArNava was unmoved.</description>

      <description>We have seen many things in life. But never have we seen something hit us as overwhelming as this. There was revolt in khANDavaprastha. It looked as though kumbhakarNa was standing there on the field and marching steadily towards us. What ever astra we hurled at kumbhakarNa simply broke to pieces and fell down. But kumbhakarNa, unaffected moved on. It was terrifying to stand there and watch all our weapons crumble like that as behemoth advanced towards us.</description>
