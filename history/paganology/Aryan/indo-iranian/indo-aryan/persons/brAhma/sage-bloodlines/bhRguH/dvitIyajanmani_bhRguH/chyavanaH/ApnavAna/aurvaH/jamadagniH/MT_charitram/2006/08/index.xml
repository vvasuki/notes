      <description>We bow to the great goddess of the trotalottaraM and pay worship to the great throng of yakShiNI-s that emerge from her. The yakShiNI-s are of diverse forms, all very wonderful and amazing. They bear many diverse facets of knowledge — he who can acquire them all becomes sarva-vyApin. But the knowledge is not easily acquired from the yakShiNI. There are so many ways in which they slip away after it has been shown to you by her.</description>

      <description>After a long time we spoke and she had much to say. She had given up active science, had been on travels to far of places, then worked as a clerk in her ancestral confectionary business and finally settled as a village school teacher in sublimely desolate expanse in the depths of Texas.
….
Charlotte had an impressive collection of stone weapons and tools made by the ancient Americans, which she had showed during expedition we had made to the expanses that lay beyond Lubbock.</description>

      <description>Our ancestors went to the great asura medhira when they were in such a state. But this time we went to deva indra. We extolled the great vR^itrahan: you who gave the yati-s to hyaenas, you who smashed the forts of the dAsas, you who slaughtered the arurmaghas, you who extirpated prahlAda and the pulomas, we offer sacrifice to you. We wish to know what happended after we moved beyond the battle pAShaNda parvata.</description>
