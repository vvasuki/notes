      <description>R called me to describe her views on the lalitArchanachandrika. This lead to a discussion of the sandhyAbhASha used in the text. So we had this conversation in mlechChita-manipravala SB.
I: “I feel close to jaya but there is a strange bhaya due to precedence”
R: “Are you really sure that you are close to jaya ?”
I: “That it is good point, I was close to grabbing the Hvarena- same time different cycle.</description>

      <description>We invested today in some heavy duty diplomatic negotiations in the hope that we may strengthen our hand for the impending battle. The negotiations went off well but we cannot be lulled into security because the enemy too is possibly using this as a ploy to obtain a dependable escape route if they are pressed hard. Funnily the situation is somewhat like Iraq (them) and the USA (us). On the occassions we smashed them, we gained little, but their constant assaults have a tremendous nuisance value.</description>

      <title>Further skirmishes</title>

      <description>We tested out a few maneuvers directly in enemy territory and we found things held pretty well. We also spied a long but interesting attack route that would carry us straight to the ground of the initial encounter. We realized that this attack route would save us a lot on investing in the baggage train. While there is one outstanding issue, we were fairly satisfied with it and will investigate it further.</description>

      <title>The first skirmishes</title>

      <description>It was a cold and blustery day. We sent out a expeditionary force to check out the fortress we had secured for the purpose of the showdown. The conditions were similar to those predicted on the lower end on the day of the impending campaign. We are still vary of fighting the encounter in the famous battle ground “Gaugamela”. Our track record was mixed. The first encounter was a dismal disaster despite the good weather conditions.</description>

      <description>We were waiting quietly on the undergrowth beside the banks of the River mahAsankaTa. There was a tense silence in the air. We had performed our karma to the best we could, but were indeed limited by our terrible short comings. Would we tide over it? Time would tell, but would we be around to receive the answer? There was no going back now. The war had been declared. The previous encounters and their results flashed in our minds eye.</description>
