      <description>We we celebrated the true arrival of spring by a remarkable wandering on the moutain paths. We felt as though the Atman had ceased to be bound and made its universal identification. As the azure heights of the celestial dome darkened with the setting eye of mitra and varuNa, we role the telescope out. One by one we ticked off each of the galaxies that lay within our reach in Leo and Virgo.</description>

      <description>Berossus, the priest of Marduk of the great god of the Babylonians declared in the 3rd century BC that 432000 solar years was the time that had elapsed from the origin of divine kingship to the end of the world. He believed that when 432000 years elapsed from the begining of divine kingship, the planets would conjunct in Capricorn and mark the begining of a world destroying fire. Many western scholars have assumed that this number entered India and was taken up by the paurANic bards for describing the mahAyuga.</description>
