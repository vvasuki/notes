      <description>The yellow autumn had slipped by silently. The white cover brought with it the short days of diablerie, and the old curse of another shivarAtri passing by was apparent. A coin fell without any apparent reason, but the omen was hardly understandable. Four roads crossed at a certain point in the southern boundary of the kingdom of the Assakas of yore. On side of one of those roads was a buffalo shed and on the other the shrine of the tribal buffalo lord, Mahsoba.</description>

      <description>It was late summer or early autumn in the year of dvAdashAnta. R and I went to that house in the afternoon. Our acquaintences were busy trying to prepare for some exam, which at least to us seemed distant. They were chattering about text books, tuitions and other quintessentially Indian fascinations. We suddenly broke away from the chatter of the plebeians. The dark one who tended to be with me decided to go away to immerse himself in this more mundane business.</description>
