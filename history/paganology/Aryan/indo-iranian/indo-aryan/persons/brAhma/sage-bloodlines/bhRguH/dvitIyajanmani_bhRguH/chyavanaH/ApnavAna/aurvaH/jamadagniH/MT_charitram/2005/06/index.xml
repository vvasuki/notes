      <description>The kR^ityA made a couple of efforts at driving home the mAraNa and continues to hover around to strike again. Day after day the attacks continue without any respite and most critically they are aiming at cutting off our means of performing the appropriate mighty rites. Today like mArIcha and subAhu obstructing the rites of vishvAmitra the kR^ityA blocked some critical rites of ours. The kR^ityA faced the rebound of our rites and was grounded, but the senders had packed the ghaTotkacha module into the kR^ityA.</description>

      <description>shachIva and amAtya met old and witch-like MJ. MJ was a great adversary of ours, but respected our battle skills greatly. She remembered how we destroyed the stuff she hurled at us, despite certain nighmarish weapons in her possession that shook us. MJ now heard of our situation and suddenly reacted very unusually by deciding to work on our side. She deployed the vaiShNava weapons. However, the kR^ityA was not countered by that and brushing it aside charged on.</description>

      <description>It is said that when pANDus conquered khANDava from the nAgas they got the curse of the nAgas. For the sake of khANDava they lost most of their sons. In the next generation parIkShit lost his life due to the nAga and so on.
We had earlier alluded to the seizure of our khANDava in what seemed a successful campaign. A little did we know that we were headed to worst of the existential crises we had ever faced as result of our possession of khANDava.</description>

      <description>Having had a major struggle with the forces of fate, and having been reduced to the condition of Jx in a certain sense, and having dropped the proverbial last wick of bhairavAnanda he was wandering around with the wheel spinning on his head. They wanted that most tasty fruit that grew atop the nR^i trees. But unfortunately for them they did not know how to nurture such trees. Hence they spoiled their sapling quite badly and there was no great success in getting the fruit.</description>

      <description>As we remarked earlier we were taking the last step before the kAlaChidra. We have taken it and now hang like trisha~Nku in the median of descent.
We decided that shall boldly face the attack and die like Dattaji Shinde or emerge at the other end with what ever scars the battle gives us. Like yayAti we had fallen head long from svarga before. But now we did not know where our fall was taking us.</description>

      <title>The kingdom in danger</title>

      <description>For the first time in our reign did we find the kingdom in such an existential crisis emerging from our earlier conquest of khANDavaprasta. We checked all past events- it looked as though most of our mantras had worked. But the enemies were very numerous and all it took was a small chink in the armour to break through. We have exactly 8 days to grind out one of our main adversaries and the kR^ityA is raining hell all the while.</description>

      <description>-Our shachiva for the first time was shaken by the hit but could not do much useful at all. We still hold on to him as he has always been trustworthy at the last ditch attempt, which cannot be achieved without his abilities in that direction.
-Our amAtya made a valiant attempt with the mantras. We saw it take on the kR^ityA, but it eventually lost and our amAtya was beaten thoroughly.</description>

      <description>We saw that kR^ityAstra course towards us and hit us even before we could do much. The muni’s efforts were blown to bits, the amAtya was tossed aside like a twig in a storm, the shachiva simply ran away from the scene. The effects are rather sapping- it just wears you out, and tries to eat out and completely destroy your mantra bala. For sometime we did not know what hit us, as though the deadly dhUmAvatI had been sent to devour us.</description>

      <description>The dumAvatI agent has a very special means of attack. It tries to destroy all the supporting systems and armors, and then zeroes in on the victim. It pressed ahead with the attempt at mAraNa. We parleyed with the agent: it revealed a peculiar prayoga of the type only known to me previously in the bauddha context. The mAraNa was to indirectly achieved via a linkage to second person. This was similar to the fate of nagArjuna when he met his end.</description>
