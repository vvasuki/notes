      <description>Marc, R and I had a strange philosophical discussion this week end, when perhaps we could have spent time in more practical but rewarding things.
R and I have for long been what may be termed bhUta chaitanya vAdins in the old Hindu parlance. We essentially believed that consciousness arose from the neural material. Marc though somewhat closer to electron orbitals than either of us in his daily existence made a strange statement: I seem to accept the reality of consciousness much more than you two, despite you all being born Hindus.</description>
