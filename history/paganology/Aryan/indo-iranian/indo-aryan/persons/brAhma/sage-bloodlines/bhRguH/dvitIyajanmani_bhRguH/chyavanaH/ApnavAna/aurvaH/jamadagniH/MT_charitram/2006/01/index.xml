      <description>Phase shifted by an year we were there forced to spend time with the wild Northerners, more precisely characterized as the fallen brahmins and kShatriyas. Luckily for us we had our own inner circle with whom we could explore the further mysteries of whippos and the secret applications. We remained there like a pAshupata verily, concealing the brahman, observing the unmatta of others, behaving like a vR^ikSha ourselves. The secret formula goes as badhira Akrandayati.</description>

      <description>We invoked the wondrous yakShini ullAsamekhalA again. She appeared in the first of her forms ‘OJ’. We asked where does the high one go? She manifested in her second form ‘GW’. It was 10 times more dazzling than ‘OJ’. She flew over the cold northern ocean to the cold, dark of ice. Then she flew back to the city with tall houses. We were so dazzled by her that we felt completely speechless and humble.</description>
