      <description>We have seen the hits of a few mAraNa prayoga-s in the past but never had we seen vaisvasvata’s agents more closely than now. Some how the Northern journey is an opportunity for the mAraNa of the vairis. We were weakened by the effects of the tapta prayoga but were still completely functional. The night before we had performed the adhara-kulAnanda rahas-tarpaNa of the beautiful but terrifying yakShiNi nIlalohita-mekhalA. We fatefully ventured out to the AvarNa-patha and were making our way for the midday oblations to savitA, when without warning we were struck by the terrifying devastambhini.</description>

      <description>As many issues remain still murky and we are still behind the haze we cannot narrate much. It was wild ride is all we can say. We knew that one of our greatest sapatna-s stood straight in our path. It was going to be a fight like the one between karNa and arjuna. Just as only one sword can reside in a scabbard, just as there can only be indra or vR^itra or just as there can be only one rAja in rAShTra it had to be one of us.</description>

      <description>Mn, Jx and me assembled for the long awaited Kuriltai of the clan on the steppes. The only one missing from our old clan assembly was the muni, who was doing his time beside the somesha shrine where we spent the most liberated days of our existence when our aged clansmen who have now attained vaivasvata were still alive. Those days were our introduction to the sanAtana dharma and aswell as the seeds of our future.</description>
