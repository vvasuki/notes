      <description>The shachIva and and the amAtya gave us the signals that three kR^ityA’s were dispatched. The strong PM, main victim of Fourier, seemed to be under what might be his final decline. The dUtas of mahiShavAhana were apparently approaching him. The muni confirmed this possibility. He had lived his life of yoga and his mahAjapa of the shatarudriya, and devotion to the vedas had given him the first 2 year respite when he was first struck by the vairiprayogas.</description>

      <description>R called me to describe her views on the lalitArchanachandrika. This lead to a discussion of the sandhyAbhASha used in the text. So we had this conversation in mlechChita-manipravala SB.
I: “I feel close to jaya but there is a strange bhaya due to precedence”
R: “Are you really sure that you are close to jaya ?”
I: “That it is good point, I was close to grabbing the Hvarena- same time different cycle.</description>

      <description>In the two years of college I was a magnet for a knot of colorful losers, such Blackie, Vidrum, Dom and Damru.
One day R walked up to me and said : “It does not do your image any good to hang out with those guys”.
I asked: “In whose eyes do I need to have an image?”
R: “The class elite”.I: “Why so?” R: “If I were not to be ocassionally seen with you, then your image with the class elite will drop to an even lower abyss”</description>

      <description>It had been pouring heavily. Normally on such a day I would have not liked to step out of the warmth of the house and drive through the slush and the dampness of the Hindustani monsoon. But that was a strange day. There was this sense of adventure that seized me and I got on to my aging black “horse” and drove on till I reached the bike stand. Having parked and not minding the oppression caused by indra’s bounty I head straight to the classroom.</description>

      <title>After the pAShaNDa hill</title>

      <description>We were trying to trace back the footsteps of besieger. We realized some of the details of what happened immediately after the pAShaNDa hill. We got out of pAShaNDa hill and were confronted by the second “born of soma”. We brushed aside “born of soma-2” pretty easily. Shortly there after an incantation followed. We believed that out pitA had taken care of that, but it was only partly so. Shaken by the recent turn of events for the first time he told us that there might have been a mistake at that point and that he might acted on a mistaken track for a whole year.</description>

      <description>The kR^ityA had hit precisely an year back. We knew that the anniversary strike was in the making. Around 2.30 PM the kR^ityA was seen again; as before, it rapidly breached all the kavachas and burnt its way through. It was like the classical pratya~Ngirasa kR^ityA described in the literature. The “Ajya tarpaNaM” held it off temporarily. We were reviewing the indra jAla 2 front with our general when she struck again.</description>

      <description>The amAtya had warned us that we would face a mAraNa strike anytime. Sensing trouble we deployed the arrows of sharva around us. The archers surrounded us completely to shield us from the kR^ityA which was to strike. We were coursing in the grip of the kR^ityA, without much apparent effect. But suddenly the ratha in which we travelled was smashed completely. We were glad that the archers had kept us alive and we escaped with life, though our ratha was completely smashed.</description>

      <description>We moved past to the nest where the root of sorrow lay like a dread beast waiting in prowl for its unprotected prey. With our prayoga-s spent on mundane battles, we needed to lift our bow and perform bhIma-karma-s as our henchmen having little foresight were tossing about like a rudderless boat. Having mentally marked ourselves for the struggle we wandered on to the beginning of the backward journey, having neutralized after some struggle the rAkShasi-s on our path.</description>

      <description>We were set to return to the same battlefield where we had last year fought one of the most disastrous battles of our existence. This battlefield was worse than the pAShaNDa hill: there we had lost out right, but here we had won the battle and the booty we took home was poisoned. It gave us no pleasure to go there but we had to do our part in the larger struggle.</description>

      <description>We saw that front #3 was a grand success in yesterday’s hostilities. We first blunted the attack by raising the water in the moat and causing the enemy troops to retreat. Then we used the naphta trick that we discovered after a terrible defeat a few winters ago. Invoking deva savitA and taking our time to launch counter-offensive we went heavy on naptha again today. The hostile forces suffered heavy losses and retreated in disarray.</description>

      <description>We shall dialate upon the cell phone+digital camera sale saga when we get the chance later. But we must remark that we reached the last shop keeping cell phones at the end of a long and arduous trek. We did not find a phone cum camera contraption. But we bought the last cell phone that lay on the last shelf. We await our fate there after.</description>

      <description>For some reason I used the word cynosure. The muni and I had a brief discussion on this word some time ago. It appears the the word cynosure is from the name tail of Canis Major (cynos-ura). This construct seems to be an archaic Indo-European word because we encounter a similar set of words as the names of the sons of the fallen bhArgava ajigarta. The most famous of them was the bhArgava R^iShi shunaHshepa Ajigarti who later became devarAta vaishvAmitra.</description>

      <description>We had earlier narrated how we had spent time in svarga with the apsaras. From there we descended to the himaparvatas- i.e for warm weather souls like us the slopes of the pAshaNDa’s hill. We continued sporting there for sometime enjoying the brief bliss of our successes. Then our ill fate brought us crashing to a low hollow in plane of pR^ithivi. We thought we had hit the nadir of existence when we were shaking from our thunderous crash to pR^ithivi.</description>

      <description>The eldest son of the great king of Nepal, pR^ithivi nArAyaNa shahA (who defeated the British and founded the Nepal Kingdom until its recent destruction by Marxists), pratApa siMha, compiled a voluminous work on the mantra shAstra during his brief life. As a companion to this a collection of pictures for the dhyAna-s on various deities was prepared by the artists in Nepal. A copy of this collection with R1’s father is of considerable interest in terms of tradition Hindu dhyAna art of which not many old samples survive.</description>

      <description>We set out on an utterly free afternoon on a long and interesting drive towards the place known as the Sahayadri. We passed by Mis-creant’s house but resisted the temptation to call on her, then we passed the hilly outcrops where the rough rowdy lived, and arrived at the spot where the muni’s horse had fallen as he was fleeing the black dasyus of viTmaru. Then we arrived at Sujata’s house.</description>

      <description>We moved up the hill rapidly (remember the hill which came in the dreams!). It was the brief pleasure sent by the gods. It was like that, which had visited the four kings, namely divodAsa, uShinAra, vishvAmitra etc in the form of yayAti’s daughter mAdhavi. But it was the shorter and wholly empty unlike that briefly enjoyed by those great kshatriyas of yore. Coursing freely in a rapid ratha we reached the paravata.</description>

      <description>With almost an year passing since the Great Fall we reflect upon him who acquired “eko mAnuSha AnandaH” that is alluded to in the texts. He lived once upon a time beside the swamp with snakes and crocodilians in it. He was of immense intelligence and physical abilities, and he was capable of performing complex rites. He was set on the path of knowing the truth. He was recognized for his speed and agility and was recruited amongst the able ones.</description>

      <description>As we have a long day ahead of us tommorow we shall be curt. We did surprisingly well on front #3 and we hope the gods favor us again in a similar encounter tommorow. We also obtained some clue regarding our ranking in the midst of the warring states. We believe we were evenly matched with our adversary. But as every one knows battles can be lost on small points. Certain unusual delays that our rivals were subject to favored us on the front.</description>

      <description>The enemy forces did not strike on front #1 as we had expected. Our spies inform us that they have decided to instead pause futher hostilities on front #1 and instead resort to the Trojan horse strategy. In our “Gaugamela”, which was in a month of blazing heat we had fallen prey to that strategy and lost terribly. We, however, learnt our lesson, even if it came at a high cost.</description>

      <description>In the year of dvAdashAnta, MP found every neuron in his brain captured by R. I believe every waking and perhaps non-waking hour of the day he was only occupied by R. In the company of other males he spoke only of R and how he may impress her. On what he thought to be the day of reckoning, our duhitaram kalashaja non-chalantly asked MP whether some eight-carbon ring with alternating double bonds will be an acid or a base.</description>

      <description>The black basaltic rock had assumed the delightful shape of a large throne, fit for a mighty rakSha like atikAya, who was slain by the saumitra. It was a cool refugium in the hot plains baked by the eye of mitra and varuNa, a far cry from its origins as a magmatic upwelling from the innards of the Earth around the time of the final demise of the non-avian dinosaurs. I rested facing the direction of the gods.</description>

      <description>Mr. Engineer of Mangalagrama (We shall call him Fourier after his fascination for illustrating Fourier transforms) had become a vairi of our clansmen on account of his daughter. His friend had controlled the bhuta that the board had and gave it to Fourier. He laid many an incantation on some our clansmen. J, was seized and broken up by his charms. J’ mother was harrassed immensely by one of those spells.</description>

      <description>From the top of the fort, from the window we watched the desolate landscape cloaked in the moist haze of indra sprinklings. The last cry of the bird had been heard for the day. The amAtya and the shachiva were caught in their own troubles due the passing of the vR^iddha. On the shore Jx sat still unable to come to terms with the fact that he was free. His mantri-s were also caught in the same troubles as our mantri-s.</description>

      <description>We invested today in some heavy duty diplomatic negotiations in the hope that we may strengthen our hand for the impending battle. The negotiations went off well but we cannot be lulled into security because the enemy too is possibly using this as a ploy to obtain a dependable escape route if they are pressed hard. Funnily the situation is somewhat like Iraq (them) and the USA (us). On the occassions we smashed them, we gained little, but their constant assaults have a tremendous nuisance value.</description>

      <description>We tested out a few maneuvers directly in enemy territory and we found things held pretty well. We also spied a long but interesting attack route that would carry us straight to the ground of the initial encounter. We realized that this attack route would save us a lot on investing in the baggage train. While there is one outstanding issue, we were fairly satisfied with it and will investigate it further.</description>

      <description>We wandered on the path by day and decided that we should wander in the pitch darkness of night. We set out slowly wending our way through the paths. We agreed that either of us would not have done on our own. midway there was the four-cross. We sat on the stones there in the middle. The black figure of Dollolas suddenly emerged from the thickets. I see the past and future with my disc, said the foremost of the nishAdas.</description>

      <description>There were the two players of Tetris who were known as Wump and Tump. They Wump and Tump were good each playing at their respective level. But obviously one was better than the other. My strI finally gave me a hint of which level I was at. I feared I was the worst of the pack but in the least there were others worse than me. So assuming that my kAmikA was right, may be I do play at a reasonable level.</description>

      <description>Hayastanika is known as sarvapriyA and mahAsurApipAnA. Thus, we mused over the turn of the chakra known as the saMvatsara. The wheel turned and sharadaH had come resulting in the dismal air that hangs over us. We decided to stay away from lalAmI and enjoy the pleasant company of Kappa, which was like a madhu-chaShaka in itself. We saw the movie sukhAvati of Campbell and then began discussing a hero with a 1000 faces.</description>

      <description>We sat on the edge of the crater of sorrow, defeat and destruction, which was much like the crater of a great volcano, with the inferal interiors obscured by pumice and granite. We saw many yakShIs, apsaras, pishAchis and rAkShasis pass by in silence. We were haunted by the memories of the fierce battle at the pAShaNDa hill in our native land in 2003. It was a demon-haunted world into which we had slipped after that battle.</description>

      <description>The harsh cawing of the solitary crow at night announces her presence. Of large size with dishevelled hair she roams. The severed heads of viShNu and rudra are seen beside her. The mystic bIja graaaM is reverberating all around her. There are the senAs of the lulApamukhas around her commanded by the dreaded kAlavAhanavadana. Beside her sits her fair daughter rakta-jyeShThA or upa-dhUmrA. Her pArshadhas are yelling hideous statements like without shivA, shiva is but a shava.</description>

      <description>bhR^igu, the founder of our race, had said that food was brahman. In that quest we set out to the city center. They say no journey in the company of a true friend is ever long. They say no wait in the company of a comely and amiable young woman is too long. But a journey in the company of a false friend or even the briefest wait in the company of a rAkShasi-like woman is a passage through naraka.</description>

      <description>We spent a lot of time in mirth with the whole assembly. The nice weather before the return of vR^itra gave a brief respite. We enjoyed it all- a good night of astronomy, a whole day of lolling around in the spring sunshine, talking about all and sundry. We lived in the present the worries of the past and the future, the dIrgha-jihvIs and their ilk were all forgotten as though they never were- as though erased by the intoxication of the mAdvIpAnas.</description>

Beyond the world of the Falcon, stationed in eternal time, were the great atharvans. udvanta AtharvaNa amongst them held a soma cup. He descended to the sattra of the 3 seers. He asked preNin the son of somAhita, madhucchandas the vaishvAmitra and asita the kAshyapa to make their wishes. preNin wished that he should have the best goat and that which ever woman he calls unto him should desire him.</description>

      <description>We heard from Jx that through the sAdhana-s his preceptor had bestowed on him he had completely repulsed the abhichAra. He was finally relieved from the flight of the crane: it was confirmed, but it had taken a severe toll on him. Most ill-effects except one on which the vairi had invested the most had been reversed. MM was considerably relieved that her mantras had rescued him. We had seen how the the siddhi of kAtyAyanI had visited MM, and later the most hallowed skanda had also visited her, so we did not doubt her abilties at all.</description>

      <description>Whenever we have executed that loop by instinct, thus far, some vighna has invariably come our way. This time again the mudgara-like blow of the trailokya-stambhinI caused us new trouble. But we received a signal to press on, undaunted. Jx who had been knocked out by the DAmarikA strike after being routed by the chIna-s, scraped the rock-bottom of his existence and fled further from bhAnu-kakSha to the township of indra-jAla.</description>

      <description>The last step had been reached. The powers of the mAnava had reached their end. Only the powers of the devas were next recourse. It is also called the setu- the bridge to the unknown loka. We had reached the end of the bridge- we stood at the door stead of the loka hidden beyond the impenetrable veil. Many fragments of thoughts crowded the brain- each having its own significance to us- we record them here for we are passing out that path, which the mAnava takes only once in his existence.</description>

      <description>It was a sombre afternoon in the year after dashAnta when Blackie and I were wedged in a convenient cleft in the wall that separated the two grounds, watching a 3rd rate cricket match played by two second division teams. Somehow my mind was not in the match at all for there was hardly anything to commend itself in the bowling or batting; nevertheless it was better than sitting through the drone of a botany lecture.</description>

      <description>Those battles were over. Our gaping breaches in the fronts of sharirasya oShadhi, dagdaratha and kosha remained, but the realization dawned on us that we had won the encounter. Our amAtya and sachIva had been unfortunately cursed with naraka which had visited then in the form of the dreadful possession of the old one. indra had however given them a boon that they would pass through naraka in pleasant surroundings. We had invested the fort of khANDavaprastha after much fighting.</description>

      <description>The critical time for khANDavaprastha had come. We were seeing signs of revolt. We deployed the dual saMGNYAnaM and kAmaM. We heavily rely on that. It had temporarily veiled the other party. But the true effects we will have to wait and see. We also need to spend a few days doing tarpaNaM to strI on laukIka matters (I wonder why women are so exaggerated in their mundane laukIka interests). Like the wandering yogI needing to please the gR^ihastrI or more precisely agastya maitrAvaruNi needing to pacify lopAmudra vaidharbhi.</description>

      <description>The kR^ityA made a couple of efforts at driving home the mAraNa and continues to hover around to strike again. Day after day the attacks continue without any respite and most critically they are aiming at cutting off our means of performing the appropriate mighty rites. Today like mArIcha and subAhu obstructing the rites of vishvAmitra the kR^ityA blocked some critical rites of ours. The kR^ityA faced the rebound of our rites and was grounded, but the senders had packed the ghaTotkacha module into the kR^ityA.</description>

      <description>The yellow autumn had slipped by silently. The white cover brought with it the short days of diablerie, and the old curse of another shivarAtri passing by was apparent. A coin fell without any apparent reason, but the omen was hardly understandable. Four roads crossed at a certain point in the southern boundary of the kingdom of the Assakas of yore. On side of one of those roads was a buffalo shed and on the other the shrine of the tribal buffalo lord, Mahsoba.</description>

      <description>shachIva and amAtya met old and witch-like MJ. MJ was a great adversary of ours, but respected our battle skills greatly. She remembered how we destroyed the stuff she hurled at us, despite certain nighmarish weapons in her possession that shook us. MJ now heard of our situation and suddenly reacted very unusually by deciding to work on our side. She deployed the vaiShNava weapons. However, the kR^ityA was not countered by that and brushing it aside charged on.</description>

      <description>The village school master, and master of the mantra-shAstra possessed many a mysterious mantra. The most mysterious was a manuscript of a tantric from around 900 AD from Uttaranchal which had in an archaic script a whole collection of mantra-s, some found no where else.

      <description>sha~Nkara bhagavatpAda had defeated the famous tantric navagupta of the pITha of kAmarUpa in a debate. navagupta unable to come to terms with his defeat invoked chAmuNDA with oblations of twigs dipped in menstrual blood and the sUtaka fluid. And thus he laid a spell on sha~Nkara. The unerring abhichAra of the great goddess had its effect on the Acharya and he was afflicted by a terrible sore in his ass.</description>

      <description>We had beaten back the fierce thrust launched by our foes on our fort. We knew that we could fend off their assault as long as we held the fort. However, on realistically assessing the situation we realized that this hardly meant that we had won the war. We had been greatly weakened by the several years of constant war on the frontiers. For an empire to remain in good health a lot actually depends on the internal conditions.</description>

I stood before the great vimalashambhu. The amR^ita flowed from the heaven cup of soma and drenched the great nityaklinnA on the 4th point of the yoni triangle. Raimented in the red, her limbs were smeared with red unguent, she held a skull bowl filled with red wine. Her face was full of smiles and restless with desire.</description>

      <description>We were passing noting the immersion of the folks in the pAsha of moha. We were trying to take the upward passage when we encountered the terrific kR^ityA. The kR^ityA was blocking our path even as the kR^ityA of rudra that swallowed our ancient clansman ushanas. We evaded her narrowly and moved past despite sustaining a blow from it. The flow of internal surA from the brahmarandhra quieted us even as a morbid yajamAna who has been struck by the fury of soma is quieted by the external surA.</description>

      <description>It is said that when pANDus conquered khANDava from the nAgas they got the curse of the nAgas. For the sake of khANDava they lost most of their sons. In the next generation parIkShit lost his life due to the nAga and so on.
We had earlier alluded to the seizure of our khANDava in what seemed a successful campaign. A little did we know that we were headed to worst of the existential crises we had ever faced as result of our possession of khANDava.</description>

      <description>We paused for a moment looking out from our high perch into the foggy haze of the air around us. The joys of the world it appeared had deserted us. The devas had sent the brief respite, but it was all over. Why are we here we asked ourselves ?
Our mind raced back to the days of war between October-December of the year 2004. It was a fairly decisive period, but little did we know what the seizure of khANDAva had in store for us.</description>

      <description>There was more than one discussion recently as to whether the tantric goddess pratya~NgirA was associated with a kR^ityA prayoga. The atharvan text clearly deploys the sUkta of pratichIna A~Ngirasa as a counter charm against kR^ityAs. An extension of the deployment, similar in spirit is seen in the R^ig vidhAna of shaunaka. MS Bhat titled his study on the R^igvidhAna as “Vedic Tantrism”. This title is somewhat appropriate because the vidhAna appears to represent intermediate condition through which the evolution of vedic prayogas into tantric prayogas occured.</description>

      <description>The day was enveloped in a forbidding gloom, and the air reeked with monsoonal decay, even as the Hindu civilization in its downward slide. The studious youth busied themselves with the most mundane of chemical experiments. Some were vigorously blowing into a charcoal lump with the hope of seeing a bead of lead. Yet others were soulfully bubbling a foul smelling miasma of sulfuretted hydrogen through a tube and waiting for a precipitate to form with bated breath.</description>

      <description>Long after the cell phone had exploded violently we lay unable to make sense of what happened in the daze of the blast. We then saw that figure moving like dhumAvati. It was laughing loudly and had all manifestations of alakShmi. We longed for the lengthy conversations with the muni. We marched through beaten path of the evil turuShka sultan with the low sun beating down upon. Having reached an appropriate bend we made our offerings of savitar and varuNa.</description>

      <description>Today I was at the Philadelphia museum- a few childhood dreams of mine were finally fulfilled. I got an opportunity to examine the following skulls and skeletons at some length:
1) The skull Eoraptor
2) The skull of Hererrasaurus
both of which are amongst the earliest theropods.
The skeletons of
3) Dromeosaurus and
4) Saurornithoides,
two deinonychosaurs close to the origins of birds
5) The second skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex (this specimen has a better preserved fore limb that allowed me study carpal and ungual morphology)</description>

      <description>Our sachIva had proposed a long and intricate escape plan that had promising aspects to it. It needed a particular maneuver that was difficult but could be achieved with the help of my greatest ally. I had started considering it seriously as an option in the event we face a defeat on the front #3. However, I suddenly realized that this escape route could very well turn out the route for exit from this earth.</description>

      <description>Some years ago R and me were lying on the grass following our quarry, a goodly specimen of Menemerus, that kept saltating in search of its quarry. Then our eyes caught sight of a Salticus specimen that was capturing a small earwig and we kept following it to observe the process. R then moved on to a Marpissa mucosa, while I drifted away towards a gorgeous Icius. At the that point for some reason we paused.</description>

      <description>A number of idols have been routinely used by my family in various upAsanas. A few are detailed below:

The rudra family: The wooden kumAra on the left is our patron deity, the deity of the clan and the protector deity. The idol is routinely installed on the trienniel skanda yAga performed as per the atharvaNa krama ordained by gopatha. The central idol is the bronze idol of uma and rudra that has been worshiped for a long time now by my clansmen for various festivals and receives regular rudrArchana.</description>

      <description>The smart and ever-scheming GS had been my student some years ago. He came from a sAma vedic family of bharadvAjas. His academic record had been a long string of successes, like the victories of Alexander of Macedon. I had lead him to a few glorious victories and he had paid me suitable dakShiNa for that. He put to good use what he learned from me as he landed one great job after another, making enormous fiduciary killings on the way.</description>

      <description>Phase shifted by an year we were there forced to spend time with the wild Northerners, more precisely characterized as the fallen brahmins and kShatriyas. Luckily for us we had our own inner circle with whom we could explore the further mysteries of whippos and the secret applications. We remained there like a pAshupata verily, concealing the brahman, observing the unmatta of others, behaving like a vR^ikSha ourselves. The secret formula goes as badhira Akrandayati.</description>

There from the hollow of an old kapala in which the offering was being made beyond the midnight hour the remarkable yakShI arose.</description>

      <description>We we celebrated the true arrival of spring by a remarkable wandering on the moutain paths. We felt as though the Atman had ceased to be bound and made its universal identification. As the azure heights of the celestial dome darkened with the setting eye of mitra and varuNa, we role the telescope out. One by one we ticked off each of the galaxies that lay within our reach in Leo and Virgo.</description>

      <description>chakra-nArAyaNa: The icon of viShNu combined with the sudarshana wheel. He is offered the combined tarpanaM of the ugraviShNu and the bahuchakra mantras.

This a replica of the idol housed in the Madhurai shrine, the city with which one of the lineages of mine is associated. Previously they were kept concealed except on the days of the special offerings.

      <description>While cleaning up, I found some old pictures R had drawn for me while in school. It brought me some nostalgia and with due permissions I scanned them to put them up. She drew much better later in life, but I was never able to get her to draw more like these again. It is sad that a great tapestry of the yogini-s, vArAhI, mantriNI, ashvAruDhA and kAmeshvarI, in their war march, that she drew with considerable detail seems to be lost now.</description>

      <description>This was her piece on the goddesses- it is a ‘combined’ vision, though the drawings are entirely hers. It was done during the most dreary of all lectures, the geography class, during which even DoM, DamAr, tuNDika, duShTa-durmukha and others fell asleep.

      <description>We had the dUradR^iShTi about the movements of the khANDavan vairi-s. We knew precisely how they were going to strike. So we waited patiently and as we knew that they had two prayogas against us and where the abhichAra was going to be placed. We saw the first graha coming and were for a while caught in its stambhana. Then the great rudra came to our aid when we made the 8-fold oblations and neutralized it.</description>

      <description>We completed the fortifications on various crags and they stood reasonably. Shortly after we had done so the hostile forces opened a massive assault on front #3. Our fortifications fended the attack, but were severely tested. We then strengthened some further outposts, and called off all diplomats. Then, tired as never before, we retired to rest. After that we went to inspect one of the fortifications, when a massive hostile thrust occurred on front #1.</description>

      <description>“Everyone knows well how the bharadvAja yavakri met his end due the kAshyapa’s spells.”
We had fallen back from suvargaM lokaM. We then started walking along the great path, when we saw a ratha similar to that of our ally of utkIla’s clan. We turned around to see the ratha, when we sensed someone was coming in front of us. We turned and were surprised to see a beautiful woman, dressed very formally.</description>

      <description>RM had a charismatic appearance and could present a himself as an intellectual. He was not a svayaM prakAsha but picked up knowledge from different generally reticent sources and presented to his circle of largely ignorant friends. He widely lectured to youngsters about the Hindu ways of mythology, philosophy, exercise and ritual performance. Most of his crowd was bored and clueless, forced to attend RM’s earnest lectures at their equally clueless parents behest.</description>

      <description>I was standing alone in the railway station in the bleak winter air. There was not a single sound and the air hung eerily as though weighed down by the cold. Suddenly the air quivered with the fluttering of a pigeon’s wings as it made its roostward retreat and then there was silence again- the shakuna! The sun sunk on the pashchima mayukha, leaving behind the gloaming and the azure depths of dyaus turned inky dark.</description>

But Fourier’s man, who was feared as shUravarman, got the news too. Never had he been intimidated thus or his men faced such uchChATana-s. He accordingly released the deadly “crane arrow”. Never was balance between life and death so clear.
Past mid-night we faced the terror of the crane.</description>

      <description>We bow to the great goddess of the trotalottaraM and pay worship to the great throng of yakShiNI-s that emerge from her. The yakShiNI-s are of diverse forms, all very wonderful and amazing. They bear many diverse facets of knowledge — he who can acquire them all becomes sarva-vyApin. But the knowledge is not easily acquired from the yakShiNI. There are so many ways in which they slip away after it has been shown to you by her.</description>

      <description>The best remembered of our expeditions were those to the city of bhairava, the fort of tridents and the long-winded peregrinations through the Maharatta countryside.In the halcyon days Mis-creant, muscleman S, his shUdra sycophant (shUdra shreShTha=SS) and me were seated on our parked vehicles and yarning in the vicinity of a little shrine of a medieaval devotional vaiShNava cult descending from the mahAnabhav cult. There were some devotional singers doling out the tune of a medieaval saint of the Maharatta country, whose song roughly translated thus: “Our pANDuraNGa is not like the goddess jAkhAI, jokhAI, mAyArANI or mhaisAbAI.</description>

      <description>A friend, in course of a yarning session, reminded me of the days of bhoga. In a social situation with Marc, R and Hayastanika we were all ganging to make fun of R. A person, who shall go un-named, remarked in full auditory range of Marc that, if R is around, people stop paying attention everyone else but her. This statement by that person could have caused me enormous social damage in an as-it-is tense situation.</description>

      <description>Never before had I descended to such a low, especially given all the show I had made. It was like Tendulkar scoring two zeroes in a row. All around us were atirathis and mahArathis (mark that word for it is indeed a pun) but still I was a mahArathi too, who had taken on the intense heat of battle. Pricked quick by the defeats I had faced, but confident about my abilities, I made a charge, even as Prataprao had done in the fateful battle of Ahmednagar, and blew away our rival mahArathis in a battle that knew no bounds in its fury.</description>

      <description>We circumambulated the large lake at the base of Mount Kearsarge with mlechCha adventurer M. We were separated from the bandhas of samsAra at that point. We saw the old va~nga chieftain at the end of it. The va~nga had battled our old foe for a long time and outwitted him much as we had. He enquired about R1, R2, R3, K1, K2 and S. These brought very painful memories to our mind.</description>

      <description>There we moved swiftly on our vAhana and placed it on the stalls. The two shUdra-s kR^iShNamukha and shUdra-shiromaNi met us at the ashvashAla where we kept our horses. One of the shUdra-s asked, O foreign brahmin, should we participate in a vigorous game of kandUka kR^iDa in the yonder kandukaprastha that lies beyond the nAga-bila and at the foot hills of the vAnara parvata. The other shUdra said: this place is blessed with many women who are the handiworks of manmatha, yet why is it we are cursed to wander in these uninteresting assemblages with nothing more of interest than the aforesaid kR^IDa.</description>

      <description>It was a cold and blustery day. We sent out a expeditionary force to check out the fortress we had secured for the purpose of the showdown. The conditions were similar to those predicted on the lower end on the day of the impending campaign. We are still vary of fighting the encounter in the famous battle ground “Gaugamela”. Our track record was mixed. The first encounter was a dismal disaster despite the good weather conditions.</description>

      <description>I received a call from him. He sounded much the same rustic fellow as I hand last enountered him over 8 years ago. His accent was the same rasping one, which sounded like a metal plate rubbing on another. I asked what had befallen him. He replied that he had been to the house beside the curve on the northward street and was quite sick after his stay there. I was shocked, that this could happen.</description>

There were two cell phones. One of mine and one of Jx. They were both mundane objects. There were numerous cell phones like that in the market. The one Jx possessed was very sleekly designed and was easy to use. The one I possessed was one which Jx coveted but I found very difficult to use. The Mumbai hecklers asked us: After all your mantra and tantra did your arcane gods only give you this cell phone?</description>

      <description>While we were still being relentless hammered by the shiva-yuvatI of mahArudra, we decided to attend to the long-standing battle where the young yoddha was faltering. It was the glorious quest of what was code-named: “ghR^itagaNa cha dvyAmlaka”, a high prize that I had earned for since my earliest days in the senAmukha, in the halcyon teens, filled with youthful intemperance. Now as a veteran of many bloody wars in which the devas had seen us through, I was still being rebuffed on that front.</description>

      <description>Berossus, the priest of Marduk of the great god of the Babylonians declared in the 3rd century BC that 432000 solar years was the time that had elapsed from the origin of divine kingship to the end of the world. He believed that when 432000 years elapsed from the begining of divine kingship, the planets would conjunct in Capricorn and mark the begining of a world destroying fire. Many western scholars have assumed that this number entered India and was taken up by the paurANic bards for describing the mahAyuga.</description>

      <description>For the first time in our reign did we find the kingdom in such an existential crisis emerging from our earlier conquest of khANDavaprasta. We checked all past events- it looked as though most of our mantras had worked. But the enemies were very numerous and all it took was a small chink in the armour to break through. We have exactly 8 days to grind out one of our main adversaries and the kR^ityA is raining hell all the while.</description>

      <description>We saw that kR^ityAstra course towards us and hit us even before we could do much. The muni’s efforts were blown to bits, the amAtya was tossed aside like a twig in a storm, the shachiva simply ran away from the scene. The effects are rather sapping- it just wears you out, and tries to eat out and completely destroy your mantra bala. For sometime we did not know what hit us, as though the deadly dhUmAvatI had been sent to devour us.</description>

      <description>We stood at the last stretch of the passage. Hence, we wanted to comment on somethings as they represent our very last comments in this phase of existence. As we remarked before we do not know if we shall speak of the face of the pishAchI. As our previous comments here, they shall be in the saMdhyAbhASha with the same codes in place.
We marched to the edge of the great shmashAna.</description>

      <description>The clansmen got to gether to take stock of the proceedings. The case of Jx was remarkable. He had been pinned down by the attack of the vairi-s who were deluding him. He finally woke up on that fateful Monday morning. His purohita pressed home with the fierce attack that hurled arrows like a hail on the attack. His vairi-s were completely gone. They were gone like the sky blown clean of all the clouds to reveal the azure heights, with nothing but the midday sun blazing on the cobalt vault.</description>

      <description>Our ancestors went to the great asura medhira when they were in such a state. But this time we went to deva indra. We extolled the great vR^itrahan: you who gave the yati-s to hyaenas, you who smashed the forts of the dAsas, you who slaughtered the arurmaghas, you who extirpated prahlAda and the pulomas, we offer sacrifice to you. We wish to know what happended after we moved beyond the battle pAShaNda parvata.</description>

      <description>We repulsed another attack on our position by the brigade from dundubhidurga. Seeing that dundudbhidurga was strategically placed to fire rockets at us, we decided to use the confusion of our foe to take the fort. I set out with a force of commandos and attacked dundubhidurga. We detonated a part of the wall an got in. We face some opposition but as our men had taken the commanding heights we were able to kill the defenders.</description>

      <description>We were waiting quietly on the undergrowth beside the banks of the River mahAsankaTa. There was a tense silence in the air. We had performed our karma to the best we could, but were indeed limited by our terrible short comings. Would we tide over it? Time would tell, but would we be around to receive the answer? There was no going back now. The war had been declared. The previous encounters and their results flashed in our minds eye.</description>

      <description>The dumAvatI agent has a very special means of attack. It tries to destroy all the supporting systems and armors, and then zeroes in on the victim. It pressed ahead with the attempt at mAraNa. We parleyed with the agent: it revealed a peculiar prayoga of the type only known to me previously in the bauddha context. The mAraNa was to indirectly achieved via a linkage to second person. This was similar to the fate of nagArjuna when he met his end.</description>

      <description>We had assembled for the gathering- me, durmukha, maireyapayin, mUlApasmara, vAta vyAdi, mlechCha sundarI, kavargA, harir-bArava all sahakuTumba. Glad to have escaped the tIkShNa hima we settled down to reel out the yarns. The conversation drifted to the journey that we had made with kalashajA to the hills in central India, where apparently bhasmasura had placed his hand on his head. kalashajA’s mother had provided us with the contact of a pious brAhmaNa woman who was civil servant in those regions held by the Dravidian tribes.</description>

      <description>What ever happened after we passed on to the other side of the guillotine we were not sure. Evidentally at that point we did not know if the guillotine had fallen or not. In reality the English encounter was the begining of the troubles. We got past the deployer of the ghora dUradR^iShTi vidyA and were resting silently. We then wandered on the Deccan plains in the year 2002, when are our armies were still unstoppable, and had a brief wandering with the muni who was declining towards the abyss.</description>

      <description>We saw the wonderous charms of Hayastanika fade behind the impenetrable veils. We conjured memories of eating the wonderous superhot mango pickle on a pleasant spring afternoon and talking of the “pancha-shara mulapadhArta” with the wonderful Kappa on the wonderful summer day in the high mountains – they were both similar. We were reminded of the distant afternoon of the “curtain” where we experienced the pleasures of R’s company. Our reverie, as the pleasures of existence, was broken by the call from Jx.</description>

      <description>Fancying myself as the wandering vrAtya I wandered in the mAnuSha lokaH. I noticed many leaving images in the eye and then in the brain. At face value these images are useless, but who knows, they may be the well-springs of future thoughts on the great moha. I appreciate daNDin that jewel of the bR^ihatcharaNa-s because of the word “bhramati”. I wandered beside the river holding my kapAla given to silence observing all.</description>

      <description>We flew up again with the yakShini. There we stood in the mid-welkin and bewitching yakShini whispered in my ear:
“We need to talk about about a profound question”.
Me: What is it?
Y: Of all those sexually reproducing beings out there, the majority of them are heterogamous There are some like Chlamydomonas that produce similar-looking gametes- the male and female gametes are the same. But the majority of cases have converged on clear anisogamy or heterogamy.</description>

      <description>kR^iShamukha and paraShumukha organized their attack at us with the deep hate and hope of overthrowing us for good– the mahochChATanaM. We were enveloped by the kR^ityA-s of dhUmAvatI that they had sent. Our senAnI had warned us well of what was approaching. We paused for a moment and decided that we must break up kR^iShamukha and paraShumukha as well as their spells as we had done to yUpa-shiras and matsya-pucCha-shiras in that great battle of dvAdasha.</description>

      <description>The great deva sanatkumAra, the son of the fiery agni, is always in the company of his two wives: the glorious biDAlAkShi and the wonderous sumukhI. The one who knows this rahasya and performs the invocation of sumukhI along with the great dhUrtasvamI will be favored by them. That glorious goddess sumukhI also called the great mahAmayUrI, engaged in amorous dalliance with the dhUrta, is described as sulabhAgati. In the midst of her yantra, the mate of kArttikeya is meditated as residing and invoked with the mighty mantra (in mantra shAstra code):</description>

      <description>We invoked the wondrous yakShini ullAsamekhalA again. She appeared in the first of her forms ‘OJ’. We asked where does the high one go? She manifested in her second form ‘GW’. It was 10 times more dazzling than ‘OJ’. She flew over the cold northern ocean to the cold, dark of ice. Then she flew back to the city with tall houses. We were so dazzled by her that we felt completely speechless and humble.</description>

      <description>On the path of nothingness we returned;
before us stood the bright prajApati,
with rudra’s bright dart pinning him to the welkin.
In one hand we held an iron trident,
in the other we held a skull.
Beyond the carcass of prajapati
shone his wain, with the ruddy gem in it struck.
Further ahead shone the six mothers,
of our patron god with the spear.
Around us stood the city’s denizens.</description>

      <description>The chance for the kuriltai was unusually solidified by the bold Argentinian adventurer. At the said hour we met with Mn and the shachiva’s prime agent. Mn, was a pioneer and even bolder adventurer than the Argentinian and was as ever silent, but he was shaken the strikes close to home. The shachiva’s agent who had maintained silence all this while, suddenly gave in to revealing the secrets of Jx. We were surprised the precision with which the shachiva’s agent described the various issues surrounding the rAkShasi.</description>

Whom shall the wise asura of the skies favor?
Whom shall the bright Aditya be the friend of?
Whom shall father dyaus and mother pR^ithivi raise to glory?
Whom will the golden-handed deva savitA impel?
The third hero has broken forth.
He has become the winner of the gaviShTi.
Those who destroyed his ratha are dead.
The abhichAryamAnas have run away from him</description>

      <description>The paths of the yakShiNi 

After having been pursued relentlessly by the kR^ityA sent against us we reached the place known as the Dismal Hollows. There we entered The House and called up the yakShiNi again. She came forth even as agni had shot up when praised by the hymns of the long gone fathers, bhR^igu, ushana kAvya, apanavAna and aurva. She created that shield that kept of the kR^ityA from coming through.</description>

      <description>R told me that her amongst her chosen devatAs whose mantras are perfect with her is bagalAmukhI. Fourier of maNgalagrAma, was initiated into bagalAmukhI vidyAs by the powerful chera magician. bagalAmukhi deployments can be terrifying for the victim and there are many of them that are generally kept secret. Some bagalAmukhi deployment that I have come across include:
   the dhattUra haritAla lepana prayoga- the yellow orpinient made from a mixture of dhattUra bIja and turmeric which can used for stambhana and vashikaraNa.</description>

      <description>The last wick of bhairavAnanda does not fall before one goes under the wheel. We saw Jx with the wheel spinning on his head. We asked him- hey Jx how did you get that wheel on your head. And lo behold, the wheel flew off his head and crashed on to mine.

      <description>It was late summer or early autumn in the year of dvAdashAnta. R and I went to that house in the afternoon. Our acquaintences were busy trying to prepare for some exam, which at least to us seemed distant. They were chattering about text books, tuitions and other quintessentially Indian fascinations. We suddenly broke away from the chatter of the plebeians. The dark one who tended to be with me decided to go away to immerse himself in this more mundane business.</description>

      <description>Our spies provided us with speculative intelligence that the hostile forces may be preparing a trap for us. However, we were not able to confirm it based on other reports. The princess of Hayastan, with calves like the quivers of kAma, gave us one of those Mona Lisa smiles and drove away on her ratha. As ever, if one meets her the right way one is transported to the shores of the ocean of bliss.</description>

      <description>svastrI had gone to check the original hall for its temperature and reported that as she came out she saw tura~NgA. My ugrakAmI tried to ask tura~NgA what she was doing there but she ran away. svastrI tried to chase her but even the pumAn have never beaten tura~NgA. The muni knew this as me and the muni had one watched a long gone duShTa chase tura~NgA and failed. I was intensely agitated by the display of tura~NgA, but the young muni who had transcended the rasArNava was unmoved.</description>

      <description>Seeing that our foes had not fired the expected salvos, we were growing curious like the legendary cat. There was a heated discussion amongst our staff whether to counter-attack or lie and wait. While we had gained an advantage on front #3, a counter-attack could prove costly, as our resources had run out. Towards night I could not bear the wait and ordered a cautious counter-attack. The hostile forces behaved unusually.</description>

      <description>We walked up the path of the hill of the vAnara, when the dasyus were not its rulers yet. There was a glorious cleft on the side of the hillock, which led to a deep valley with wonderfully eroded paths. There a cool breeze often blew and we wandered around with the muni, kumbhodbhavA, and occasionally kR^iShNavarNa and the rAmAnujavAdin. The muni and myself had installed a installed a large li~Nga there for the worship of The god in the cleft and worshipped it with the brAhmi plant and the sha~Nka puShpa.</description>

Bis einst ich höre Kanonengebrüll
Und wiehernder Rosse Getrabe.
Dann reitet mein Kaiser wohl über mein Grab,
Viel Schwerter klirren und blitzen;
Dann steig ich gewaffnet hervor aus dem Grab,
Den Kaiser, den Kaiser zu schützen.

      <description>I had been chatting somewhat wastefully with an acquaintence of mine, on topics ranging from the awful goddess dhumAvati to certain internet personalities. Thereafter I was just planning to leave when I saw a call flashing on my phone from a local but unfamiliar number. Fearing that it may be something to do with my henchman who had landed in the hospital due to some wierd illness, I picked it up.</description>

      <description>Marc, R and I had a strange philosophical discussion this week end, when perhaps we could have spent time in more practical but rewarding things.
R and I have for long been what may be termed bhUta chaitanya vAdins in the old Hindu parlance. We essentially believed that consciousness arose from the neural material. Marc though somewhat closer to electron orbitals than either of us in his daily existence made a strange statement: I seem to accept the reality of consciousness much more than you two, despite you all being born Hindus.</description>

      <description>We have seen many things in life. But never have we seen something hit us as overwhelming as this. There was revolt in khANDavaprastha. It looked as though kumbhakarNa was standing there on the field and marching steadily towards us. What ever astra we hurled at kumbhakarNa simply broke to pieces and fell down. But kumbhakarNa, unaffected moved on. It was terrifying to stand there and watch all our weapons crumble like that as behemoth advanced towards us.</description>

      <description>We had a discussion with K, ST and R about some web sites they were reading about obtaining the average facial type of a given population. They pointed me to a great free morphing software that did it- SQIRLZ MORPH. I decided to try my hand at creating the average Hindu young male face. I am not sure if this is really an average for nothing statistical has been done.</description>

      <description>She said: “We return to that halcyon year and a half. When the son of Brinda was toiling relentlessly, fueled by testosterone and goaded by his crafty, parents we set out the seek the truth. Beyond the row of 3 shUdras were two: one a shUdra and one a brAhmaNa.”
I said: “We return indeed to that time in our walk. We were free, like never before and never after.</description>

      <description>Anandavardhana was a remarkable figure. In my Sanskrit learning I gave him the skip because the theory and practice of alaMkAra never struck a chord in me in my youth (I also had a great excuse). My mother spoke of a lot of theory and practice of alaMkAra literature but I realized soon that her way of conveying it was not at all for me. In any case my then AchArya found my excuse convincing and maintained that we could continue with analysis of the yajur vedic prose when I returned.</description>

      <description>GK had been a rival of R. R had genuine knowledge, but GK merely absorbed everything she read without much analysis or understanding. Otherwise they were quite equally matched. GK oozed arrogance, but R emanated genuine mental superiority over most. GK always had the ethnic advantage in both the lokas, but R was in the “foreigners” category. Still R was victorious over GK till the fourth year, after which she departed for the quest of “higher glory”.</description>
