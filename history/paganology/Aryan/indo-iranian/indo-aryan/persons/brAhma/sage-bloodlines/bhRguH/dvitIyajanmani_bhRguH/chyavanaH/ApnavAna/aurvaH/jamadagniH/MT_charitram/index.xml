      <description>We moved past to the nest where the root of sorrow lay like a dread beast waiting in prowl for its unprotected prey. With our prayoga-s spent on mundane battles, we needed to lift our bow and perform bhIma-karma-s as our henchmen having little foresight were tossing about like a rudderless boat. Having mentally marked ourselves for the struggle we wandered on to the beginning of the backward journey, having neutralized after some struggle the rAkShasi-s on our path.</description>

      <description>The black basaltic rock had assumed the delightful shape of a large throne, fit for a mighty rakSha like atikAya, who was slain by the saumitra. It was a cool refugium in the hot plains baked by the eye of mitra and varuNa, a far cry from its origins as a magmatic upwelling from the innards of the Earth around the time of the final demise of the non-avian dinosaurs. I rested facing the direction of the gods.</description>

      <description>We were ruing the crushing defeat on the field code-named jIvamUlIya pa~ncha-koNaM cha shulbArIya halaM by the five mlechCha attackers. We felt like Shivaji after the great fort of Purandar was taken by the ghazis. While we sat ruing our defeat and the loss of the small but strong force sent to wrest the pa~nchakoNa and shulbArIya hala that we much desired, we wished that indra give us victory here. We knew that GS of boundless energy, the descendent of the great dIkshita, was a man who had attained eko-mAnuSha AnandaH.</description>

      <description>The jAnashruteya birds flew by and said: “The spider has run around the web twice since that fateful night of the 3-front war. 2 bow-shots away from your seat you saw the deadly one. It was the same place where your then senAnI immersed in sorrow narrated his defeat against the vaiShNava on the Northern plain. The kR^ityA-s were kept aside from reaching you by the eye of mitra and varuNa.</description>

      <description>It was relatively late when we were sort of startled by R’s call. She said we had a visitor from really ancient times- Igul. One forgets most males, at such a distance in time, but then some women are much harder to forget (the male brain seems to be wired so). I must be careful of what I say here for yudhiShThira cursed women that they will not keep their mouth shut.</description>

      <title>Saved from the mAraNa prayoga by the yakShiNi</title>

      <description>We have seen the hits of a few mAraNa prayoga-s in the past but never had we seen vaisvasvata’s agents more closely than now. Some how the Northern journey is an opportunity for the mAraNa of the vairis. We were weakened by the effects of the tapta prayoga but were still completely functional. The night before we had performed the adhara-kulAnanda rahas-tarpaNa of the beautiful but terrifying yakShiNi nIlalohita-mekhalA. We fatefully ventured out to the AvarNa-patha and were making our way for the midday oblations to savitA, when without warning we were struck by the terrifying devastambhini.</description>

      <description>I received a call and we set off for the evening. The women-folk wanted to make their stock of powders and pickles for the quarter and had spent the day collecting their ingredients. As we converged at the pre-destined venue. While the women milled away at the kitchen, Marc and me had planned to re-live some youthful fancies that we much missed- we had planned some experiments. R had told Marc of the dIpAvallI vacation of ekAdashAnta, when she and me had experimented extensively with what in bhArata were known as snake-tablets.</description>

      <description>We had the dUradR^iShTi about the movements of the khANDavan vairi-s. We knew precisely how they were going to strike. So we waited patiently and as we knew that they had two prayogas against us and where the abhichAra was going to be placed. We saw the first graha coming and were for a while caught in its stambhana. Then the great rudra came to our aid when we made the 8-fold oblations and neutralized it.</description>

      <description>As many issues remain still murky and we are still behind the haze we cannot narrate much. It was wild ride is all we can say. We knew that one of our greatest sapatna-s stood straight in our path. It was going to be a fight like the one between karNa and arjuna. Just as only one sword can reside in a scabbard, just as there can only be indra or vR^itra or just as there can be only one rAja in rAShTra it had to be one of us.</description>

      <description>With the due assent I decided to narrate the account of R1‘s father&amp;rsquo;s encounter with the vile pAShaNDa-s of the nAstIka mata- this is an illustrative example of some technicalities for the complete uchChATana of paShaNDa mantras. The other learned vR^iddhA had also demolished the prayoga-s of such a pAShaNDa from the vanga country. The old R1F had journeyed deep into the were the practitioners of the fallen ways of mahAchInAchAra and upachInAchAra still wandered.</description>

      <description>After much struggle our forces fought their way to a strong position on the front of the dvayaM daNDakAH. We were close to taking this much desired and important outpost after a really long drawn conflict. But, just then the news reached us on the khANDavan front that something we always suspected from the fateful day of Nov 30, 2004 was true. It put us in an even more complicated mess on that front.</description>

      <description>After a long time we spoke and she had much to say. She had given up active science, had been on travels to far of places, then worked as a clerk in her ancestral confectionary business and finally settled as a village school teacher in sublimely desolate expanse in the depths of Texas.
….
Charlotte had an impressive collection of stone weapons and tools made by the ancient Americans, which she had showed during expedition we had made to the expanses that lay beyond Lubbock.</description>

      <description>The muni and me were in a sense like branches of the same tree. We wondered what might have happened if only the muni and me could have joined our forces on the battle field. Our coordination on the field was unmatched. We saw eye-to-eye in the conduct of campaigns and the like. The only difference was that we matured at different times. I grabbed the vidyAs when they had to be acquired, but the muni ambulated in a random walk for long before he achieved them.</description>

      <description>Mn, Jx and me assembled for the long awaited Kuriltai of the clan on the steppes. The only one missing from our old clan assembly was the muni, who was doing his time beside the somesha shrine where we spent the most liberated days of our existence when our aged clansmen who have now attained vaivasvata were still alive. Those days were our introduction to the sanAtana dharma and aswell as the seeds of our future.</description>

      <description>The varanopids are a lineage of synapsids whose distinctness and wide distribution has come to light more recently, even though Romer described Varanops elegantly in his early monographs. More recently Reisz and Laurin, the experts on these topics, described a relatively large varanopid, Watongia, from the Oklahoma Chickasha formation. This synapsid was discovered by Olson in 1974 but was poorly understood until a few years ago. Watongia appears to share a hallmark feature of two other varanopids, namely the postorbital tuberosity if the authors’ interpretation of the skull is correct.</description>
