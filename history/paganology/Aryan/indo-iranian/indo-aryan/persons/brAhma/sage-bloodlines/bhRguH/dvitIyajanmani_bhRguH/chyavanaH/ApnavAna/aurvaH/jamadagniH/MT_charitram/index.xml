      <description>We were ruing the crushing defeat on the field code-named jIvamUlIya pa~ncha-koNaM cha shulbArIya halaM by the five mlechCha attackers. We felt like Shivaji after the great fort of Purandar was taken by the ghazis. While we sat ruing our defeat and the loss of the small but strong force sent to wrest the pa~nchakoNa and shulbArIya hala that we much desired, we wished that indra give us victory here. We knew that GS of boundless energy, the descendent of the great dIkshita, was a man who had attained eko-mAnuSha AnandaH.</description>

      <title>Saved from the mAraNa prayoga by the yakShiNi</title>

      <description>We have seen the hits of a few mAraNa prayoga-s in the past but never had we seen vaisvasvata’s agents more closely than now. Some how the Northern journey is an opportunity for the mAraNa of the vairis. We were weakened by the effects of the tapta prayoga but were still completely functional. The night before we had performed the adhara-kulAnanda rahas-tarpaNa of the beautiful but terrifying yakShiNi nIlalohita-mekhalA. We fatefully ventured out to the AvarNa-patha and were making our way for the midday oblations to savitA, when without warning we were struck by the terrifying devastambhini.</description>

      <description>I received a call and we set off for the evening. The women-folk wanted to make their stock of powders and pickles for the quarter and had spent the day collecting their ingredients. As we converged at the pre-destined venue. While the women milled away at the kitchen, Marc and me had planned to re-live some youthful fancies that we much missed- we had planned some experiments. R had told Marc of the dIpAvallI vacation of ekAdashAnta, when she and me had experimented extensively with what in bhArata were known as snake-tablets.</description>

      <description>As many issues remain still murky and we are still behind the haze we cannot narrate much. It was wild ride is all we can say. We knew that one of our greatest sapatna-s stood straight in our path. It was going to be a fight like the one between karNa and arjuna. Just as only one sword can reside in a scabbard, just as there can only be indra or vR^itra or just as there can be only one rAja in rAShTra it had to be one of us.</description>

      <description>After much struggle our forces fought their way to a strong position on the front of the dvayaM daNDakAH. We were close to taking this much desired and important outpost after a really long drawn conflict. But, just then the news reached us on the khANDavan front that something we always suspected from the fateful day of Nov 30, 2004 was true. It put us in an even more complicated mess on that front.</description>

      <description>After a long time we spoke and she had much to say. She had given up active science, had been on travels to far of places, then worked as a clerk in her ancestral confectionary business and finally settled as a village school teacher in sublimely desolate expanse in the depths of Texas.
….
Charlotte had an impressive collection of stone weapons and tools made by the ancient Americans, which she had showed during expedition we had made to the expanses that lay beyond Lubbock.</description>

      <description>Mn, Jx and me assembled for the long awaited Kuriltai of the clan on the steppes. The only one missing from our old clan assembly was the muni, who was doing his time beside the somesha shrine where we spent the most liberated days of our existence when our aged clansmen who have now attained vaivasvata were still alive. Those days were our introduction to the sanAtana dharma and aswell as the seeds of our future.</description>
