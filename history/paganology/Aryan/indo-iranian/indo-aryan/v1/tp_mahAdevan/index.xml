      <description>Mahābhārata It is well-known that the Mahābhārata has come down to us in two recensions, the Northern and the Southern. The editors of the Poona Critical Edition (1933-70)1 of the epic determined, in the process of collating and isolating the archetype of the epic, that its Northern Recension (NR) constitutes in general what is called in textual scholarship the editio simplicior, the naive or the original text, and they created the Critical Edition (CE) from the irreducible archetype of the NR texts, the Śārada codex of the Kashmir region in the northwest of South Asia.</description>

      <description>I start with Sukthankar’s master chart of the recensional history for the epic as a whole:
 Vyāsa’s Bhārata Ur-Mahābhārata N  υ  Śārada K   γ  ε  Nepalī Maithili Bengali   Devanāgarī     S  σ  Telugu Grantha   Malayalam    The Vyāsa phase of the epic, the so called Jaya Bhārata, began perhaps in an oral tradition, by consensus in the Kuru area, and most likely in the kṣatriya circles, as a lay about war for land and territory, perhaps based on the Ten King Battle of the Ṛgveda (Witzel 2006: 21-24).</description>

      <description>i: The Origins of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, their Śrauta Traditions, and Southward Migration We know that the style of wearing one’s hair was a matter of ritual importance to the Vedic Aryans, often signifying adherence to a specific orthodoxy-orthopraxy complex. The term kapardin/kapardī, itself thought to be non-Vedic,20 occurs in the Ṛgveda, with six attestations (s.v. Lubotsky [1997] I: 420) in its different forms and seems to have signified the braided or tufted hair on a male’s otherwise shaven head, and the Vasiṣṭhas are said at ṚV 7.</description>

      <description>i. The Origins of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, Their Śrauta Traditions and Their Arrival in the Tamil Country The outwardly distinguishing feature of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, corresponding to the pūrvaśikhā of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, is their aparaśikhā, “pin kuṭumi,” or back tuft in Tamil, as opposed to the “mun kuṭumi” or front tuft of the Pūrvaśikhās (Illustration 2; the illustration is a painting in the Panjab Hills school of the 16th century, precisely the area to which we will trace the Aparaśikhā group below.</description>

      <description>Impressive proof for the above links between the history of Brahman migration and the textual history of the SR of the Mahābhārata is furnished by the history of the Brāhmī scripts and their various derivatives, as it has been re-constructed by Iravatam Mahadevan (2003). We must keep in mind we cannot have a textual tradition without a phonologically appropriate script, linking, in other words, the epic to the relevant human agency, the third correlate in the equation.</description>

      <description>1 Sukthankar, V.S., et al., eds. 1933-70. Mahābhārata: Critical Edition. 24 volumes with Harivaṃśa. Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. Almost every editor of the Critical Edition comments on the general differences between the two recensions; the sustained exposition of these is to be found in V.S.Sukthankar’s Prolegomena, i-cx, in his edition of the Ādiparvan (1933).
2 The picture as it relates to the Critical Edition of the sister epic, the Rāmāyaṇa is altogether a different matter for want of a Sukthankar-like figure in the editorial team.</description>

      <description>1a. Nambudiris [Namboothiris] Malayalam-speaking. Traditional home is Kerala, almost exclusively so as to be though aitochthonous, but attested in the Cōḻa land till about the 8th century CE, presumably as part of a larger Pūrvaśikhā population with the many rare Veda śākhās and the forelock kuṭumi common to the entire group. Good, reliable information about the the community is available in the Namboothiri,com, a professionally maintained and managed website.
A live Śrauta tradition is attested among them, arguably the most authentic.</description>
