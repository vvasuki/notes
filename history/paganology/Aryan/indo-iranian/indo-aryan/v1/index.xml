      <description>Elevation to v1 by British  Bhumihars of Bihar and U.P. did not participate in the common front of Brahmins and Rajputs in 1857. Maharajas of Benaras, Hathua and Bettiah rendered signal service to the British during 1857. On the other hand the Britishers believed that 1857 was the mechinations of Brahmins and Rajputs in Bihar and U.P. Maharani Victoria&amp;rsquo;s declaration on Ist November, 1858, obliquely accepted the Caste hierarchy of Hindu Society.</description>

      <description>Early peopling  mihirkula brought many V1s to revive culture in kAshmIra. I suspect sadyojyotis was among those v1s from roughly that time keeping with the idea of his Kashmirian locale. Also his focus on raurava-sUtrasaMgraha and svAyambhuva suggest an early age. - MT
 Later exoduses  In 1990, kAshmIri muslims with and Islamic agenda forced out kAshmIri paNDit-s from the valley.  </description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;An ancient text reveals the migration of a Brahman priest called Subinarayan from the west Tripura and his marriage with a native woman, Haokei Chanu Thoinu. &amp;hellip; Almost all the Brahman priests, with the exception of a few of them, had migrated to Manipur without spouses. They married the local women generally from the lower social strata. &amp;hellip; They accepted Meiteilon (Manipuri language) as mother tongue. They were assigned varied yumnaks (lineages) based on their places of origin25 , professions, ways of life and so on.</description>

Purvashika means tuft pointing to the front. b. Aparaśikhā brahmins who constitute the vast bulk of brahmins in Tamil country today&amp;hellip;who settled for the most part during the mature Pallava / Chola period (5th to 10th century).</description>
