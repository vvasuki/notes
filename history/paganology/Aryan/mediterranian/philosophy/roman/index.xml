      <description>Spirits with no rigid shape  Sources: sentona97 System of beliefs centered around family and life after death was called “the religion of Numa”. In its essence it’s animism – spirits (numina) were connected with all things, beings and acts of people. In Roman animism every being, thing, activity or idea had their divine character and meaning. The forces of nature, therefore, weren’t personified in human or any other physical shape.</description>

      <description>Sources: sentona97  Motivations  Openness: For Romans, deities were ones who had to serve their purpose. If the purpose wasn’t served even if you gave sacrifices, they would try their luck from another deity or the manifestation of the same deity. This is one of the reasons why many foreign deities and cults were popular. Romans would also implement deities of people they were in war with. This was done in order to attract deities on their side, so they can leave their enemies and be victorious.</description>

      <description>Sources: sentona97  Cult origins  The collegium of Vestal virgins was fundamental for the security of the Roman state. Even though the origin of the Vestals is said to be made by the legendary king Numa Pompilius, their origin is probably much older. Originally, the temple of Vesta was in the shape of a round hut made out of straw and clay with a pointed roof where the girls took care of the fire.</description>
