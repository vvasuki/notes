      <description>It is fair to state that bhAskara provides a clear description of the concept of the differential. This can be seen in his treatise siddhAnta shiromaNi (chapter gaNitAdhyAya; section gatisphuTiprakaraNa). He clearly states that this is a formalization of the approximate formulae given by the earlier AchArya brahmagupta.
He defines two quantities: 1) sthulagati (roughly speed) that is defines as ratio of the distance travelled by a object to the time taken for that.</description>

      <description>The hymn RV 1.99 is a peculiar hymn in many ways:
jātavedase sunavāma somam-arātīyato ni dahāti vedaḥ |
sa naḥ parṣadati durgāṇi viśvā nāveva sindhuṃ duritātyaghniḥ ||
It is addressed to agni jAtavedas: We extract soma for jAtavedas; may he the knower consume the wealth of the evil enemies. May agni tide us over our troubles, through difficulties as in a boat across the river.
The hymn is the one sUktaM in the R^ig that comprises of a single R^ik.</description>

      <description>The great brAhmaNa vAchaspati mishra, who was described as “sarva tantra svatantra” provides a model that is equivalent to the 3D cartesian system in his work nyAya vartika tAtparya TIkA (4.2.25) to describe molecular/atomic contacts. The 3 axes were termed pUrva-pashchima, uttara-dakShiNa and urdhva-adhara. The position of any point is given by measuring the the distance along these direction. The position of contacts between atoms can then be given as numerical series of these coordinates.</description>
