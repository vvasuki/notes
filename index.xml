      <description>Europe Economic union Many countries in Europe are part of a union which allows easy travel and relatively free trade with low taxation. Many are also use a common currency, Euro, issued by a central bank.
A big part of the motivation for doing this was to quell fears that the strong German economy might again give rise to an expansionist war-machine.
Euro [Incomplete]
Strength of economies Economic viability of sovereigns is discussed elsewhere.</description>

      <description>Plant cells have organelles called platelets which enable photosynthesis of food.
Predation Catching food Predators may be mostly static, lying in wait for prey to come to them. Or, they may actively move and entrap or chase down food.
Baiting Predators may attract food organisms to a certain location for entrapment. Eg: brightly colored flowers of the venus fly trap, the attractive tail of the rattle-snake.
Overcoming a single prey A prey is usually overcome using asphyxiation, bleeding, cutting, crushing or poison.</description>

      <description>Conditional distributions and notation Got observations of events: RV \(X\) took values \(\set{x_{i}}\), deduce/ model the process causing those events. In general, we want to model the conditional distributions \(f_{X_r|X_{\lnot r}}\). Often, we use the alternate notation \(Y = X_r\) and \(X = X_{\lnot r}\).
Connection to modeling marginal density Note that \(X_{\lnot r}\) may be empty, so that marginal/ unconditional distribution modeling - which is estimating \(f_X(X)\) - is a special case of conditional distribution modeling.</description>

Core problem Input and response variables A label/ target/ response/ dependent \(L\) depends on some predictor/ input/ independent variable \(X\) (a set of features/ covariates).
Range of X and L Input space is \(D\) dimensional.
\(range(L)\) may be a subset of a vector space. It may be continuous or discrete.
Labeling rule sought The agent/ decision rule produced by the learning algorithm must label \(L\) some unlabeled test point(s) \(X\), after some observations/ examples/ training points \(S\).</description>

      <description>Although it stands to reason that a samurai should be mindful of the Way of the Samurai, it would seem that we are all negligent. Consequently, if someone were to ask, “What is the true meaning of the Way of the Samurai?” the person who would be able to answer promptly is rare. This is because it has not been established in one’s mind beforehand. From this, one’s unmindfulness of the Way can be known.</description>

      <description>Total variation distance between distributions Aka Statistical distance. Sample space X. \(\Del(D, D&amp;rsquo;) = 2^{-1} \sum_{x \in X} |D(x) - D&amp;rsquo;(x)|\): \(\in [0,1]\). But, \(\sum_{x \in X} (D(x) - D&amp;rsquo;(x)) = 0\).
Visualize as space between probability curves. Total prob under either curve is 1.
Largest deviation in event probability For event \(E \subseteq X: \max_{E \subseteq X} |Pr_{D}(x \in E) - Pr_{D&amp;rsquo;}(x \in E)| = \Del(D, D&amp;rsquo;)\). Or, max (signed) area between curves covered by E is at most half the total area.</description>

      <description>Discrete L: Response probability: Discriminative models Boolean valued functions One can use boolean valued functions to get deterministic models of the form \(y = f(x)\). These functions are considered in the boolean functions survey and the computational learning theory survey.
Probability from regression models Take any (continuous variable regression) model \(f: X \to [0, 1]\). Such a model can be interpreted as modeling the probability distribution \(f_L\).
Advantages of modeling probability The classifier doesn&amp;rsquo;t care whether \(C_{1}\) is called class 1 or class 100.</description>

      <description>Specification and classes A distribution is often specified by a pdf or a cdf involving certain parameters. Or it may be specified by a stochastic process generating some values: ie in terms of other other distributions.
Sometimes, the density specified need not even be proper (sum/ integrate to 1) to be useful: Eg: In applying the conditional probability inversion trick.
Notation If the pdf of \(X\) is a member (identified by the parameter \(p_1\)) of the function family \(\set{f(p)}\), we write \(X \distr f(p_1)\).</description>

      <description>Certain numbers reveal the current evaluation of the economy. The health of the economy can be roughly viewed in terms of the financial health and confidence of 4 major components: consumers, banks, non-bank businesses, government.
Eg: Prices of critical commodities (like oil), value of index funds, growth in real estate prices, government debt, public debt.

      <description>Notation Consider a function class \(C\) defined on the input space \(X\). Let \(p\) be a probability measure on \(X\).
Euclidean Vector spaces The definition of standard inner product and \(l_p\) norms can be extended to work with function spaces, when they are regarded as vector spaces with dimensionality equal to \(|X|\); while also considering the \(p\). These are described in the vector spaces survey.
Metric space using Disagreement probability One can define a metric space using the norm \(d(f, g) = Pr_p(f(x) \neq g(x))\).</description>

      <description>Academic hiring follows a different pattern.
Selectivity Hiring people is generally easier than getting rid of them. So, when possible, businesses create interview processes which have low ’false positive’ rates - even at the cost of high ’false negative’ rates.
Process Often, specialized recruiters are used to make initial contacts with people - in order to get an idea of where how the candidate may fit the company’s needs. That person then may pitch the candidate to potential hirers.</description>

      <description>Automated processing Sensory perception involves not only the sense organs, but also specialized circuitry in the brain. This is akin to input devices + software drivers in the case of computers.
Perception often involves attention, but all processing is non-explicit and non-verbal.
Signal sparsity The brain deduces most of what it knows from scant filtered signals.
Eyes keep moving around from nose to eye to lips etc.. So actual information observed is actually small, the brain does not know what is happening outside this small area.</description>

Addition, scalar multiplication Addition of vectors is naturally defined: \((u + v)_i = u_i + v_i\). Scalar multiplication is similarly defined.
Geometric model: coefficient sequence Can be interpreted as a point in the cartesian space \(F^{n}\); but which point? That depends on what the basis vectors model, the units, the inner product between them.

      <description>Mahābhārata It is well-known that the Mahābhārata has come down to us in two recensions, the Northern and the Southern. The editors of the Poona Critical Edition (1933-70)1 of the epic determined, in the process of collating and isolating the archetype of the epic, that its Northern Recension (NR) constitutes in general what is called in textual scholarship the editio simplicior, the naive or the original text, and they created the Critical Edition (CE) from the irreducible archetype of the NR texts, the Śārada codex of the Kashmir region in the northwest of South Asia.</description>

      <description>Economies generally keep cycling through periods of booms and busts (described below). This is due to heuristic way in which demand and supply are balanced.
Boom To meet demand, industry in certain sectors grow - often on borrowed money, counting on future profits. Industries indeed produce profit for some time, but production keeps increasing until production exceeds demand.
During this time, the industries’ economic value - or at least their evaluation by the securities market- grows.</description>

      <description>It is said that much sake, self-pride and luxury are to be avoided by a samurai.+++(5)+++ There is no cause for anxiety when you are unhappy, but when you become a little elated, these three things become dangerous. Look at the human condition. It is unseemly for a person to become prideful and extravagant when things are going well. Therefore, it is better to have some unhappiness while one is still young, for if a person does not experience some bitterness, his disposition will not settle down.</description>

      <description>Aka smRti.
Procedural vs declarative knowledge Knowledge can be declarative or procedural depending on whether it is stored using some language (which may include words, sounds, pictures, videos, touch, taste etc..); here we are concerned with the former kind. Procedural memory is considered separately.
Importance Memory (short and long term) is fundamental to computation (mechanical or animal). Like thoughts, memory is like a mosaic, rather than linear.
Classification, uses Depending on how quickly stored information (memory) is forgotten, memory is classified into short and long term.</description>

      <description>Banks initially often may try to restructure the debt - allow later payment, increase installments, reduce interest etc..
Recovery attempts Defaulters borrow money from banks but fail to pay back. THen, the bank employs various means - seizing assets of defaulters or better yet those who guaranteed payment, shaming and illegal coercion in some cases to recover the money. Defaulters with political power often get their debts written off.

Importance Government design determines the type and the quality of the services provided by the government. Bad governments are often a result of bad design.
Legislature Legislatures have great power because they determine the laws/ policies; the executive and judiciary merely execute them.</description>

Distribution structure/ sparsity Seek to represent some factorization of the joint probability distribution concisely, thence conditional independence relationships too. In many cases, these factors involve small subsets of variables: sparsity in the dependency graph.
Eg: \(f_X(x) = Z^{-1}\prod_{C \subseteq V} \gf_{C}(x_C)\). Compare notation with exponential family distributions.</description>

      <description>Motivating a hired employee to do his job involves ensuring that his pleasure/ satisfaction (perhaps even pain) coincides with benefits and loss of the company.
The best case is when the employee, by nature, cares deeply about doing his job well - which is why good hiring is important.
Another alternative is to do this using rewards and threats. Research shows that for menial/ mechanical tasks, this works; but for creative work, this approach is counter-productive.</description>

      <description>Random vector A random vector is an n-dim vector \(X = (A_{i})\), which are a bunch of jointly distributed random variables. Similarly, \(X\) can be a \(m \times n\) random matrix.
Below, we consider \(X = (X_1, X_2)\), where \(X_1:(S_1; F_1, v_1) \to R_1\) and \(X_2:(S_2; F_2, v_2) \to R_2\).
A random vector is itself a random variable \(X:(S_1 \times S_2; F_1 \times F_2, v) \to (R_1 \times R_2)\).
Marginalization The marginalization properties of the joint/ product probability space leads to: \(Pr(X_1 \in E_1, X_2 \in S_2) = Pr(X_1 \in E_1)\), so \(\int_{E_1 \times S_2} f_X(x) dv = \int_{E_1} \int_{x_2 \in S_2} f_{X}(x_1, x_2) dv_2 dv_1 = \int_{E_1} f_{X_1}(x_1)dv_1\).</description>

Probability measure The following axiomatization is common to both frequentist and subjective interpretation of probability.
Take sample space \(S\), sigma algebra \(F\). The probability measure is a special measure \(v:F \to [0,1]\); so operates over sets, like CDF. Additionally, the general additivity property (described in algebra survey) is usually assumed.
Other properties of the measure: should be countably additive over disjoint sets: \(\gs\) additive; \(v(\gO) = 1\).</description>

Let the state at time t be \(X_{t}\). Let \(V\) be the set of possible states.

Mean/ Expectation of real valued RV Aka Expected value. \(E:\set{RV} \to R\). \(E[X] = \mean = \int_{X} x f_X(x) dm = E_{X}[X]\).
This is the weighted average of \(range(X)\). \(E[X]\) is actually a convex combination of points in range(X).
Subscript notation See probability section.

      <description>Aka concentration of measure inequalities.
Expectation based deviation bound (Aka Markov&amp;rsquo;s inequality). If \(X\geq 0\): \(Pr(X \geq a) \leq \frac{E[X]}{a}\): \(Pr(X \geq a)\) is max when \(X\) is 0 or a.
Averaging argument. If \(X\leq k\), \(c\mean Pr(X\leq c\mean) + k(1-Pr(X\leq c\mean)) \geq \mean\); so \(Pr(X\leq c\mean) \leq \frac{k-\mean}{k-c\mean}\).
This technique is used repeatedly in other deviation bounds based on variance and moment generating functions.

      <description>Monarchy In the past monarchy, based on armed or religous support, was common. Succession was based on very narrow nepotism - this often led to fragile states whose fortunes varied wildly over the generations: See nepotism section of business succession for details.
Democracy In democracies, legislatures are constituted by election. [Incomplete]</description>

      <description>An insolvent bank, having made bad investments, is incapable of repaying depositors.
Guarantees Small depositors are guaranteed to get their money back, up to a certain limit- usually by government agencies. But, such guarantees do not protect big investors.
Economic consequences Bad money lending leads to ruin of the lender; sometimes selling ownership of these loans on the stock market, they bring ruin to others: 2008 financial crisis resulted from bad housing loans in USA, for example.</description>

      <description>GDP growth usually requires investment in business enterprise. But, investments may have returns either in the short-term or in the long-term. Investment which responds to consumer demand yields immediate benefits, and is often favored.
Investments vary in quality: for example, a rich government investment firm can increase GDP by just building cities which will never be occupied in the desert.
Consumer demand and public debt Individuals borrow money, and they have to repay them.</description>

      <description>Problem Suppose that one observed RV \(\seq{Z_n}\) and a filtration or a series of events \(\seq{F_n}\), with the property that \(F_n \supseteq F_{n-1}\).
Suppose further that: \(E[|Z_{n}|] &amp;lt; f(n) &amp;lt; \infty\), that \(Z_n\) is fully determined when \(F_n\) is observed, and \(E[Z_{n}|F_{n-1}] = Z_{n-1}\) (or \(E[Z_{n}|F_{n-1}] - Z_{n-1} = 0\)).
This process is the martingale \(\seq{Z_n}\) wrt filtration \(\seq{F_n}\).
Example The filtration can correspond to the observation of a sequence of random variables \(\seq{X_n}\).</description>

Exponential decay and bilateral-exponential decay distributions are described elsewhere.
Inverse squared decay Aka Cauchy distribution. Parameters: mean/ mode \(\mean\), height-at-mean parameter \(h\). The pdf is \(C(x; \mean, h) = \pi^{-1} (\frac{h}{(x - \mean)^{2} + h^{2}})\).
Limited to positive deviation Aka half-Cauchy distribution. Parameters: mean/ mode \(m\), height-at-mean parameter \(h\). Range of the random variable is \([m, \infty]\).</description>

L, NL, polylog space, \(PSPACE = NSPACE\). \(L \subseteq NL \subseteq P \subseteq NP \subseteq PSPACE\): One of these is \(\subset\): from space hierarchy theorem.
\textbf{Reachability method} on configuration graph: \
\(NSPACE(f(n)) \subseteq DTIME(2^{f(n)})\).
Directed reachability in \(DSPACE(log^{2} n)\) (Savitch) \chk. So, by reachability method: \(NSPACE(f(n)) = DSPACE((f(n))^{2})\). Reachability is NL complete. \why
Immerman-Szelepcsenyi: \(Unreachability \in NL\).\

      <description>Automaticity Some procedures/ skills may require theoretical knowledge and its conscious, planned implementation - this uses both long term and working factual memory.
Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, uncontrollability. Such behavior may possibly be in response to stimulii. They are aka habits. When their optimality in accomplishing a certain task is measurable, they are called skills.
Examples Piloting: not a conscious skill - so need to make mistakes on simulator, besides conscious understanding of mistakes.</description>

      <description>i: The Origins of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, their Śrauta Traditions, and Southward Migration We know that the style of wearing one’s hair was a matter of ritual importance to the Vedic Aryans, often signifying adherence to a specific orthodoxy-orthopraxy complex. The term kapardin/kapardī, itself thought to be non-Vedic,20 occurs in the Ṛgveda, with six attestations (s.v. Lubotsky [1997] I: 420) in its different forms and seems to have signified the braided or tufted hair on a male’s otherwise shaven head, and the Vasiṣṭhas are said at ṚV 7.</description>

      <description>Problem One wants to probabilitically model &amp;lsquo;affinities&amp;rsquo; (joint, conditional probabilities) of entities of two or more types. Entity types are modeled by discrete random variables (say \(W\) and \(D\)).
Motivation Besides common motivations for modeling joint distributions of random variables, one may want to model affinities probabilistically in order to get low dimensional representations of one or both of these entities (motivations for which are described in the dimensionality reduction chapter of the statistics survey).</description>

      <description>Social costs A society often pays an excessive price for economic growth in the form of environmental pollution, eroding social/ cultural values, compassion.
Inflation The injection of new money by governments to favor economic growth leads to inflation/ currency devaluation, which disproportionately affects the poor, for the following reason.
The poor spend a greater fraction of their income on food/ raw materials, whereas rich tend to spend a greater fraction of their wealth on services.</description>

      <description>Taxation In exchange for government services, people and businesses pay taxes on their incomes/ gains (any increase in wealth). So, the government collects taxes on behalf of its citizenry.
Taxation rate and service level Some highly ’socialist’ countries (Eg: Scandinavian countries, France etc..) tend to have high taxation rates, and provide excellent services to their citizens in return. Other countries, like USA, have low taxation rates and in return provide low-quality public services.</description>

      <description>Workers collectively have greater bargaining power while negotiating terms of employment (salary, benefits, leave, penalties) with their employer. To this end, they form trade unions.
Breakdown of negotiations When negotiations with employers break down, they go on strike - that is halt work without pay, thereby causing loss to the employers. Employers sometimes try to get around the problem by hiring new workers who will accept poorer conditions and work - which often leads to violence and damage, and hence is an unattractive option.</description>

Occurrence near sentence terminals We want to use the notation \(w_n|w_{1:n-1}\), with \(n\) fixed, for considering the event where \(w_n\) appears after the string \(w_{k+1:n-1}\) appearing at the beginning of a sentence - distinct from the case where \(w_{1:k}\) is some specific string.

Role of proability theory Facile and formal use of probability theory is a good idea. In any case, probability estimation in animal intelligence can be understood using the belief/ Bayesian interpretion of probability theory.</description>

      <description>aka manas by Hindus. Attention control is akin to task scheduling in computers
Types Attention could be endogenous or exogenous (response to a loud noise). Endogenous attention is thought to involve frontal cortex and basal ganglia. Depending on whether it involves focusing sensors, attention is overt or covert.
Number of tasks Attention may be directed at a single or multiple tasks. Usually multitasking is accomplished by focusing on each task for a short period of time.</description>

      <description>Many cities, states and countries outside have greater expenditure than revenue, a gap which is often projected to widen as time passes.
Quantification Government deficit is often measured as a percentage of the GDP, which is much larger than the actual income of the government alone. Anything over 10% is considered too high.
Expectations without willingness to spend Often people expect unrealistically good public services from the government, without the willingness to spend a proportionate fraction of their income.</description>

      <description>When Lord Takanobu was at the Battle of Bungo, a messenger came from the enemy camp bearing sake and food. Takanobu wanted to partake of this quickly, but the men at his side stopped him, saying, “Presents from the enemy are likely to be poisoned. This is not something that a general should eat.” Takanobu heard them out and then said, “Even if it is poisoned, how much of an effect would that have on things?</description>

If the country where the disaster occurs is advanced - like Japan or USA, effect on the GDP may not even be noticeable both in the short and the long term.</description>

      <description>Observations, states \((X_i)\) are called features/ covariates/ predictor/ input/ observed variables. \(\seq{L_i}\) is the unobserved response/ state variable sequence. \(X_i\), being a partially dependent of \(L_i\), can be viewed as a partial observation of the state \(L_i\).
The state space is \(ran(L_i)\), while the observation space is \(ran(X_i)\).
Use These models are not only used for deriving models for \(f_X\), but also for determining the state sequence \(L\) given \(X\).</description>

Analyzing \(X\) and Y; If there is uniform symmetry in X, set \(X\) to be any value without loss of generality.
Cast the problem into a stochastic process : Eg: Markov chain/ Random walk problem, Martingale.
Bound probabilities and expectations Break up big events into smaller cases One can analyze \(Pr(A)\) using \(Pr(A) = \sum_b Pr(A|G)Pr(G)\).

Defeating one’s allies is defeating oneself, and defeating oneself is vigorously overcoming one’s own body. “It is as though a man were in the midst of ten thousand allies but not a one were following him. If one hasn’t previously mastered his mind and body, he will not defeat the enemy.” During the Shimabara Rebellion, his armor being still at the encampment, Shugyo Echizen no kami Tanenao participated in the fight dressed only in hakama and haori.</description>

Data preparation and assumptions Saling, centering, addition of bias variables is assumed below. That, along with motivation, is described in the statistics survey.
Generalized linear model Linear models Here, we suppose that \(L|X \distr XW + N\), where \(N\) is a 0-mean noise RV. Then, \(E[L] = XW\), which is linear in parameters \(w\).</description>

      <description>Making a choice is fundamental to behavior. It fundamentally involves comparison.
Reasoned vs automatic It may involve simulation, possibly with explicit verbal reasoning to various degrees.
Preset Preferences Decisions not involving explicit reasoning are made using set preferences. Some preferences are formed due to developmental environment; while some tastes are acquired consciously due to habit formation. Right from the womb, the human baby learns the rhythm of its mother&amp;rsquo;s language, the taste of food she ingests; and adapts its behavior upon being born.</description>

      <description>Aka emotion, vikAra.
Distribution over actions/ thoughts Emotion was defined by behaviorists in terms of probability distribution over responses (either to stimuli, or physical reactions/ sensations including in the brain) Eg: sadness increased certain type of responses; while others identify it purely with certain mental sensations or neurochemicals. One may extend this distribution to cover thoughts as well.
Modes of cognition/ operation On may draw an analogy with a computer which can operate in different modes; and whose computation and output distribution changes according to the mode.</description>

Universal health care Universal Health Care in many countries is free or low cost.
Quality The quality in many countries is good - In France there are even house-calls. In other countries beset with inefficient executive branches, like India, public health care is often low quality - though even there, there are islands of high quality.
Delays, overuse Free health care is often overused, leading to resource scarcity given that a limited amount of money is alloted for health care.</description>

      <description>1a. Nambudiris [Namboothiris] Malayalam-speaking. Traditional home is Kerala, almost exclusively so as to be though aitochthonous, but attested in the Cōḻa land till about the 8th century CE, presumably as part of a larger Pūrvaśikhā population with the many rare Veda śākhās and the forelock kuṭumi common to the entire group. Good, reliable information about the the community is available in the Namboothiri,com, a professionally maintained and managed website.
A live Śrauta tradition is attested among them, arguably the most authentic.</description>

      <description>There was a certain retainer of Ikeda Shingen’s who started an argument with a man, grappled him to the ground, thrashed him soundly, and trampled on him until his companions ran up and pulled them apart. The elders conferred over this and said, “The man who was trampled should be punished.” Shingen heard this and said, “A fight is something that goes to the finish. A man who forgets the Way of the Samurai and does not use his sword will be forsaken by the gods and Buddhas.</description>

      <description>Schools Most countries provide free universal compulsory primary education for children. Quality varies.
Tuition Access to prestigious universities/ schools may be limited, so there is often a competitive exam; for which there often exists special tuition/ cram schools.
Higher education In some countries (like Scandinavia, France), government heavily subsidizes higher education; while in others students must mostly rely on other sources, and accrue huge debts.</description>

      <description>Estimate parameters using statistics The distinction between choosing parametric and non-parametric approaches are considered in the decision theory section.
Statistic, estimator A statistic \(\hat{t} = \hat{g}(X)\) is a function of the sample \(X\); an observable random variable. When it is used to estimate some parameter, it is called an estimator. t can be estimated by estimating \(\gth\).
Point estimation of the parameter If \(\hat{t}\) tries to approximate \(t\), it is an estimator.</description>

      <description>The problem \(\min f_{0}(x): V \to F\) subject to constraints \(f_{i}(x) \leq b_{i}\). Vector \(x\) is optimization variable of d dimensions. \(f_0\) is optimization fn. \(b_i\) are limits/ bounds for constraints.
Standard (primal) form \(\min_x f_{0}(x): \set{f_{i}(x) \leq 0}, \set{h_{i}(x) = 0} \): all are \(V \to F\) functionals.
Explicit constraints \(f_i\) and \(h_i\) are explicit constraints. Problem is unconstrained if it has no explicit constraints.
Implicit constraints \(x \in D = \inters dom(f_i) \inters dom(h_i)\).</description>

Linear Constrained QP Aka Quadratic programming. Minimize convex quadratic functional over a polyhedron (see vector spaces survey). Generalizes linear programming, special case of QCQP.
Visualization If optimal value occurs when a constraint is active: Think of contours of the objective hitting an edge of the polyhedron. Slightly harder than in the LP case, where the minimum always occured in a vertex.</description>

      <description>Luring away businesses More businesses mean more tax money, and prosperity of the nation. So, territories (cities, states or countries) try to lure businesses from each other - they usually have special agencies called ’Economic development agencies’ which do this.
They sometimes offer tax-breaks in the initial years to attract businesses. They also try to achieve concentration of talent by offering pre-setup infrastructure and by setting up special economic zones where companies will get tax benefits.</description>

      <description>In the “Notes on Martial Laws” it is written that: The phrase, ”Win first, fight later, ” can be summed up in the two words, “Win beforehand.” The resourcefulness of times of peace is the military preparation for times of war. With five hundred allies one can defeat an enemy force of ten thousand. When advancing on the enemy’s castle and then pulling back, do not retreat by the main road, but rather by the side roads.</description>

      <description>Businesses, left to themselves, often operate to increase their own profit at the expense of the environment and the general economy.
Regulation about working conditions are described in another chapter.
Competition promotion Governments then try to ensure that no company gets a monopoly on any market, as monopoly reduces progress and keeps the prices up.
Illegal activities Disadvantaging competition Microsoft, in the 1990’s, bundling the internet explorer browser with its operating system, disadvantaged rival browsers and gained monopoly.</description>

      <description>As a retainer of the Nabeshima clan, one should have the intention of studying our province’s history and traditions, but provincial studies are made light of nowadays. The basic reason for this study is to understand the foundation of our clan, and to know that the clan’s forefathers established its perpetuity by means of their suffering and compassion. The fact that our clan has perpetually continued in an unrivaled manner up to this very day is due to the humanity and martial valor of Master Ryuzoji Iekane, the charity and faith of Master Nabeshima Kiyohisa, and the appearance of Lord Ryuzoji Takanobu and Lord Nabeshima Naoshige and their might.</description>

      <description>Formulating the problem Focus on easily solved forms Modellers of natural phenomena and engineers formulate optimization problems. They know what classes of problems are easy to solve. So, they often draw on a mental library of functions, composition rules to create, for example a convex program.
Dealing with strict inequality constraints Replace with non-strict inequalities.
Use equivalent formulations (for convexity?) You can always replace \(f_0(x)\) or \(f_i(x)\) \
with a \(p(f_i(x))\) if p is monotonically increasing with \(f_i\), and if you can translate between \(\argmin f_0(x)\) and \(\argmin p(y)\) or between \(f_i(x) \leq 0\) and \(p(y) \leq c\).</description>

      <description>The problem Importance, efficient solvability Superset of LP. Many problems in nature are convex optimization problems. Many non-convex problems have convex equivalents : see section on modelling/ specifying optimization problems.
(Nesterov, Nemorinsky) For any convex optimization problem, there exists self concordant barrier functions; so interior point methods and barrier methods can be made applicable: This is a non constructive proof. So, there exists a polynomial time algorithm for every convex optimization problem, but you will find it with certainty only if you can find these self concordant barrier functions.</description>

      <description>Mean: estimation Consistency Aka Law of large numbers
Let \(\set{X_{i}}\) iid. \(\hat{X}_{n} = n^{-1}\sum^{n} X_{i}\). As \(var[\hat{X_{n}}] = \stddev^{2}/n \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\), Weak law: \(\hat{X}_{n}\) is a consistent estimator of \(\mean\).
Normalness of estimator distribution Aka Central limit theorem (CLT)
Take estimator \(U_{n} = \frac{\bar{X} - \mean}{\frac{\stddev}{\sqrt{n}}}\). \(lt_{n\to \infty} Pr(U_{n} \leq u) = \int_{-\infty}^{u} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-t^{2}/2}dt\): so approaches CDF of N(0,1): See convergence of moment generating function (MGF) below.</description>

      <description>Continued prosyletizing tendencies Thus, Zoroastrianism expanded by conversion of existing priesthoods in addition to chieftains – just as Islam would later do in Persia. Further, with time, this confederacy expanded and began to convert people of not just other clans but other ‘ethnicities’. It was a strongly proselytizing faith, and also an imperialistic one. Eventually, a particular confederation clicked and they rapidly expanded and created a new empire in the Middle East and C.</description>

      <description>Initial acceptance &amp;ldquo;Yazdegerd I&amp;rsquo;s reign was a landmark for the Christians in Iran. With the counsel of Roman bishop Marutha, he acknowledged the Church of the East in 410; this led to the establishment of the Iranian church, which would declare its independence from the Roman church in 424. &amp;hellip; One of his gestures of generosity was to permit Christians to bury their dead, which Zoroastrians believed tainted the land. The number of Christian elites in the bureaucracy increased, a flow which continued until the fall of the empire in 651.</description>

      <description>Schism of the liberals Eventually, this ossification gave rise to several waves of new ideologies to counter Zoroastrian “orthodoxy”, movements that became very popular, such as Mazdakism, etc. &amp;ldquo;In 484, Persian king Peroz I was killed on campaign, and most of the Sasanian army was destroyed. This disastrous defeat provoked a crisis of succession and touched off more than a decade of unrest, during which time a renegade Zoroastrian priest named Mazdak (who preached common ownership of possessions—and women) became an influential figure.</description>

      <description>Intro Nevertheless, the wholesale capitulation of Iran under Arabs was unexpected, even by the radical subversives and defectors. While Iranians were needed to run the affairs of administration, they were unable to engineer a Persianization campaign. Instead, it began to look increasingly like Iran would become Arabized like Syria (a process well laid-out in Islam, to make non-Arabic converts into “mu’arrabeen”).
The evolution of gnostic schools within Islam were continually borrowing from Mithraism, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism and Buddhism.</description>

      <description>Early settlements Some of the mercantile Zoroastrian communities had already set up small communities in India’s Gujarat just before Islam. After the invasion, part of the aristocracy and priesthood fled to join them. Later, more merchants followed, and also people of the professions. These together formed the Parsi community, comprising the 4 castes of Iranian orthodoxy.
During the extermination drive by the Qajars, when life for Zoroastrians was extremely humiliating – being treated as untouchables as per the Islamic concept of “nijasah” – many came to India in the last 2 centuries.</description>

      <description>The dynamics between later Hinduism and Buddhism is worth studying to understand why we have since had this repeated process of counter-religions and counter-priesthoods emerging in India, that often mutate to become not just an antinomian voice within the civilization but downright anti-national. The Indic and transnational Buddhist mercantile networks were at the forefront of arguing for peace and compromise with the new Islamic empire. Little did they know that they would be culled once their role as useful idiots was complete.</description>

      <description>The mahA-chInAchArya, shubhakara siMha, a nAstIka of the second varNa, was a remarkable, even if forgotten, figure in history largely forgotten in his homeland India. He was a descendent of the ikShvAku chieftain amR^itodana whose clan held a small kingdom in what is the border between modern Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. They were overthrown by the rAShTrakUTa army and as a consequence fled to oDDiyAna pITha in central Asia. Here they established themselves as rulers of oDDiyAna.</description>

      <description>Nilakantha Shastri brings attention to the Indian rulers of Khotan and has attempted to reconstruct their chronology from various sources.
Map of Khotan
In the period that followed the death of the great emperor lalitAditya, and the confusion during the reign of saMgrAmapIDa, the Chinese generals Yao Yao and Wei-ch’ih-Sheng devised a daring plan to take Khotan. With the help of the internal Sinitic population they engineered a revolt and suddenly appeared at the head of a massive Chinese army of 80,000 to beseige and conqueror the kingdom.</description>

      <description>It has often been stated that many of the martial failures of Hindus has been due to the use of ponderous and slothful elephants in war. However, the Indians seem to have persisted with elephants until very recently. They first started using elephants right at the dawn of their civilization in the Indus period. What is the truth behind the elephant’s utility?
“bhagadatta on his elephant, supratika, showering arrows on his foes, looked like the resplendent Sun scattering his rays on the earth… Like a cowherd driving his cattle in the forest, bhagadatta charged on his elephant repeatedly smiting the pANDava host.</description>

      <description>“Brahmins do not have it in them to fight” was a common refrain I had heard despite being brought up on the tales of the bhR^igu conquests of yore- r^ichIka, jamadagni, rAma, agni aurva and all of them. I had almost internalized it. But my conversations with PR got me thinking about it from different angles till I discovered the truth. My learned AchArya had a peculiar regard for PR: he would regularly come to recite the R^ig veda when he taught it and would only talk with our AchArya in Sanskrit.</description>

Normally on such a day I would have not liked to step out of the warmth of the house and drive through the slush and the dampness of the Hindustani monsoon. But that was a strange day. There was this sense of adventure that seized me and I got on to my aging black “horse” and drove on till I reached the bike stand. Having parked and not minding the oppression caused by indra’s bounty I head straight to the classroom.</description>

      <description>Abstract data types When data is stored, we often want to perform various operations (ie evaluate mathematical functions) on it.
Abstract data type is a mathematical construct of a data-store, defined by the operations which can be performed over it, and consistency rules (which define the effect of the aforementioned operations on the stored data). For example, a stack can be defined using push, pop operations, with constraints such as pop(push(stack, x)) = x.</description>

      <description>View of memory If in writing code, one thinks in terms of instructions and data which can be understood by a processor (eg: bytes in the main memory, registers, hardware IO signals), one is working with a low level language.
High level languages allow the programmer to think of memory locations and data more abstractly/ declaratively by starting with assumptions that there exist memory locations with certain properties which will be bound to variables used by the programmer by the compiler with the OS’s help.</description>

      <description>Fundamentals The basic problem in advertising is finding the audience who is likely to buy the product/ service (target audience).
Placement and position There may be place for a limited number of advertisements to be displayed in a certain venue. Yet, there may be several advertisers competing for those places. Further they may be interested in gaining favorable placement in the ad-list.
Coupon distribution Consider a seller wanting to advertise inventory to target customers, or wanting to spur business.</description>

      <description>In general, memory declines with age. But, for a few people, it remains clear and functional. [National Geographic, Nov 2007]
Metrics White matter naturally degrades as we age—causing disrupted communication between brain regions and memory deficits—after conducting a battery of cognitive tests and brain scans on 93 healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 93. The observed weakening of these brain network interactions (associated with default state and executive functions) was significantly correlated with a measured decline of cognitive functions as a result of aging.</description>

      <description>Factors affecting price Travel date/ day Tickets cost more in certain months.
Tickets tend to cost more on Fridays, saturday, sunday, than on weekdays (especially monday).
Airport demand/ competition Flights from Dallas or houston probably cost less than flights from austin.
Operation costs Some airlines are cheaper than others.
Fuel costs This constitutes a major part of the operating costs.
Airlines which have access to cheaper fuel - either due to a stockpile (Southwest Airlines in 2000-2009), or geographic location (Emirates airlines) can offer lower prices.</description>

      <description>No Hindu should forget the deaths of the valiant Rai Jaimal Rathore and Pratap Sisodia (Patta). A comparison of the Hindu chronicles of the Rathores of Badnor and Akbar’s Fathnamah reveals a discrepancy that I believe is a creation of Akbar. Of course the secularists who have penned the modern Indian history texts have whole-heartedly accepted Akbar’s narrative as they fall in the line of providing an Islamic narrative for Indian history.</description>

      <description>The kR^ityA had hit precisely an year back. We knew that the anniversary strike was in the making. Around 2.30 PM the kR^ityA was seen again; as before, it rapidly breached all the kavachas and burnt its way through. It was like the classical pratya~Ngirasa kR^ityA described in the literature. The “Ajya tarpaNaM” held it off temporarily. We were reviewing the indra jAla 2 front with our general when she struck again.</description>

      <description>Analysis of algorithms For analysis of randomized algorithms, see randomized algorithms, probabilistic analysis ref.
Asymptotic behavior How does the problem scale with increasing input size? See computational complexity ref. Usually care about worst case and average case performance.
Amortized analysis Got a sequence of operations performed by a deterministic algorithm. Maybe every n operations, a huge cost is incurred. Then, even though, in the worst case, the cost is high, on average, each operation costs much less.</description>

      <description>This remarkable issue was brought to my attention by a person who specifically wishes to remain un-named on these pages on account of certain private reasons related to this narrative. It is clear that Shahji was a rather distinguished military leader and he had transmitted this genetically influenced trait to not only his famous son Shivaji, but also the forgotten elder son Sambhaji.
In reality he also passed these genes on to another son who has been largely forgotten in modern Maharatta histories.</description>

      <description>The amAtya had warned us that we would face a mAraNa strike anytime. Sensing trouble we deployed the arrows of sharva around us. The archers surrounded us completely to shield us from the kR^ityA which was to strike. We were coursing in the grip of the kR^ityA, without much apparent effect. But suddenly the ratha in which we travelled was smashed completely. We were glad that the archers had kept us alive and we escaped with life, though our ratha was completely smashed.</description>

It is remarkable for its portrayal of this conversion as a colonial process, led and controlled by representatives of a new (foreign) religious movement. Albeit in collaboration with (a subjugated and obedient) section of the domestic nobility, this foreign Christian religion is only imposed after fierce battles against the (native) pagan leadership and its popular supporters.</description>

      <description>Using assymetric key cryptography One simple way of authentication is to encrypt and return a challenge message using one&amp;rsquo;s secret key.
Using a password This is very common - eg: it is used over to log into terminals.
To beat snooping, passwords are transmitted over a secure channel (eg: ssh vs rsh).
One-time passwords Passwords may be spoofed - even over a secure channel by an adversary who jumps into a session and replays the password message to, for example change the password.</description>

      <description>Grammar Definition A grammar specifies a language by describing structural rules which can be used to accept or reject a sentence. So, each grammar is associated with a language.
It is fully described by (Variables, Terminal chars/ alphabet, Start symbol, Production rules).
Production rules are of the form: string including variable V \(\to\) string with variables and terminal symbols, formed by replacing \(V\) with somwething else.
A given string is accepted if, starting with the start symbol, using a finite number of production rules, one can arrive at the string.</description>

      <description>ATM-s Banks usually have a network of ATM machines whence cash may be drawn and deposits made. A debit card is issued for their use. They may be associated with an incentive to encourage its use: why?
Use of ATMs maintained by other banks results in fees, eg: 2$ for BoA; which may be refunded by the bank with the account.
Remote deposits Banks often offer smart-phone applications or websites from which deposits can be made.</description>

      <description>We were set to return to the same battlefield where we had last year fought one of the most disastrous battles of our existence. This battlefield was worse than the pAShaNDa hill: there we had lost out right, but here we had won the battle and the booty we took home was poisoned. It gave us no pleasure to go there but we had to do our part in the larger struggle.</description>

      <description>Definition When a company declares bankruptcy, it says that it is incapable of meeting all of its financial commitments/ liabilities. All of its agreements with trade-unions are then also canceled.
The business’s assets can be liquidated (seized, valued and sold) to satisfy its liabilities. Also, the company may be taken over and restructured; and the new owner can repay outstanding debts.
Rescue Motivation The government is often motivated to rescue failing businesses to prevent negative consequences like job loss, reduction in national pride etc.</description>

Large areas of the brain are associated with the use of hands.
Degree of automation Behavior can be automatic or not, depending on the extant to which declarative memory is used; the latter class is called executive function, which involves planning, decision, error control. General aspects of cognition which underly this are considered elsewhere.</description>

      <description>It is fair to state that bhAskara provides a clear description of the concept of the differential. This can be seen in his treatise siddhAnta shiromaNi (chapter gaNitAdhyAya; section gatisphuTiprakaraNa). He clearly states that this is a formalization of the approximate formulae given by the earlier AchArya brahmagupta.
He defines two quantities: 1) sthulagati (roughly speed) that is defines as ratio of the distance travelled by a object to the time taken for that.</description>

      <description>I have always felt a close affinity to bhaTTa jayanta, the great scholar from kashmIra. He lived in the 800-900s of CE and was associated with the dictatorial king shankaravarman who kalhaNA describes as a corrupt despot. kalhaNa informs us of his lack of education and culture by stating that this king spoke only apabhramsha, a language fit for drunkards (I told our Hindi teacher these very words, which she has not forgotten since :-), I hear) .</description>

      <description>Copied here from MT&amp;rsquo;s blog.
Vedic regard In the Rgveda the gotama-s repeatedly and respectfully mention the bhRgu-s as the founders of the fire rite, which is consonant with their position at the head of the shrauta gotra-pravara lists.
For example:
 dadhuSh TvA bhRgavo mAnuSheShvA rayiM na chAruM suhavaM janebhyaH |
hotAram agne atithiM vareNyaM mitraM na shevaM divyAya janmane ||RV 1.58.6
 Here nodhA gautama declares that the bhRgu-s first established the ritual fire in the midst of men.</description>

      <description>Copied here from MT&amp;rsquo;s blog.
The imprint of the bhRgu-s is not just all over the literature of bhAratavarSha but also dotting the very expanses of the land of the bhArata-s. While being a bhRgu, I may be biased to see this imprint more than others, the fact has been observed by many others. The following is a purely parochial view of history seen through the lens of my ancestry, yet I believe there are elements of real significance for the history of the Hindu nation.</description>

Maharajas of Benaras, Hathua and Bettiah rendered signal service to the British during 1857. On the other hand the Britishers believed that 1857 was the mechinations of Brahmins and Rajputs in Bihar and U.P. Maharani Victoria&amp;rsquo;s declaration on Ist November, 1858, obliquely accepted the Caste hierarchy of Hindu Society.</description>

Efficient operations  Single row lookup. Scan row ranges/ prefixes. Scan column, timestamp ranges  Advantages  Scales easily, shards as necessary (during &amp;lsquo;compaction&amp;rsquo; times). Shards are called tablets. Shards may be overloaded before the unpredictable compaction times, so intelligent key distribution may be desirable.

      <description>Intro The body language is indeed a language with words and phrases. The body can communicate even when there are no spoken words. The primary function of body language is to express emotions and status among surrounding animals; and its vocabulary is specialized for that. Using body language, one can speak multiple words simultaneously.
Importance of mastering it Body language is widely understood, often unconsciously. Bad skill at it is often results in miscommunication.</description>

      <description>\(p^{1/n} \to 1\): take seq \(x_{n} = p^{1/n}-1\). Also, \(n^{1/n} \to 1\).
Bounds on combinatorial quantities Bounds on n! (Stirling)\(n!\approx \sqrt{2n\pi} (\frac{n}{e})^{n}\). \why
Bounds on (a choose b) \(\binom{a}{b} = \frac{a!}{b!(a-b)!} \approx \frac{a^{a}}{\sqrt{2n\pi} b^{b}(a-b)^{a-b}}\) for large a, b and a-b.
So: \(\binom{a}{b} \leq (\frac{ea}{b})^{b}\). \(\lceil \frac{a}{b}\rceil \leq \frac{a-1}{b}+1\). \(\frac{e^{m}}{\sqrt{em}}&amp;lt; \frac{m^{m}}{m!}\leq \sum \frac{m^{i}}{i!} = e^{m}\). \((\frac{a}{b})^{b} &amp;lt; \binom{a}{b} &amp;lt; a^{b}/b!\).

It states that a bow should have 3 material: iron, horn and wood and should be 4 cubits in length. The Bow string is supposed to be made of bamboo fiber, hide or bark fiber. The middle part is recommended to have grip for the hand. The shape should be that of the “eye brows of a beautiful damsel” .

      <description>It is the weave of the fabric (the size and number of holes) that determines breathability or resistance to air movement. Any woven or knit fabric will breathe - even if the weave is made of rubber strands.
If the yarn on the outside of the garment is thinner than the yarn on the inside of the garment, capillary action will pull water to the outside. The increased surface area (not hollow fibre cores) of the thin yarn gives the water more space to spread out.</description>

Most new cars are sold with a three-year/36,000-mile warranty. Therefore, if you buy a car that is from one to three years old, with less than 36,000 miles on the odometer, it will still be under the factory warranty.</description>

      <description>Intro Sometimes, cells in an organism go rogue; they don&amp;rsquo;t listen to signals from other cells, and start reproducing and form a tumor; they hog the nutrient supply coming to that region.

      <description>Tax is levied on one’s gains realized using the sale of security holdings or from interest/ dividend income on such securities, with some quirky rules.
Term Long-term capital gains (Eg: selling stock after holding it for a year) are usually taxed at a lower rate.
Subscribing to a dividend reinvestment plan complicates calculation of capital gains.
Wash sale One can offset gains obtained by selling some securities by selling securities on which one has made a loss - but it is forbidden to buy the same security again immediately after doing so (wash sale).</description>

      <description>Belt Useful not only for holding up pants tightly to the waist, ensuring good weight distribution, but also enables attachments like pouches.
Buy a synthetic material belt, ideally one which can be used in professional circumstances, with very little metal (no big belt buckle), so that it need not be removed for airport security checks.
Cargo pants/ shorts Can be found in military stores or online. Professional look is achievable.</description>

      <description>Abstraction Aka general abstract nonsense. Abstract from sets and relations to categories and morphisms.
Category (Class ob(C) of objects, morphisms or arrows hom(C), composition op: \(\cdot\)) with \(\cdot\) identity, associative \(\cdot\). Category Eg: Set, \(Vect_{k}\).
Small category: aka CAT: both ob(C) and hom(C) are sets, rather than classes.
Morphisms Homomorphism: A structure (identity, inverse elements, and binary ops) preserving funciton f: f(x)=3x preserves addition. Isomorphism: both f and \(f^{-1}\) are homomorphisms.</description>

So, common standards have evolved to represent these characters with natural numbers or characters visible on most English keyboards or arbitrary bytes.
ASCII This represents the Latin alphabet plus some common characters. Range: 0:255.
Special characters include control characters.
Control characters Carriage return (move cursor to beginning of current line), line-feed (start a new line), tab (a long horizontal space).</description>

      <description>These are especially useful for highly liquid items Eg: negotiable securities. Portfolio decisions can be based on looking at the chart for the appropriate time period. With a chart, one can observe features like support and resistence levels. Thence, one can decide whether it is a good time to buy or sell an equity.
This is because charts contain in them the evaluations of large fund managers etc.. But that can be misleading in case of bubbles.</description>

      <description>Parameters  Suction power. Should suffice to change air 10 times per hour.  Alternate guide: If kitchen is in separate room, 600 m3/h suffices. Else, good to go for 1200 m3/h.   Size: 60x60 (2-4 burners), 90cm (3-5 burners) Autoclean: Better suction power and life.  Turbine blower forces air to move to chimney walls (oil goes thence to a collection bowl, which should be washed every month).

Manufacturing China has a trade surplus relative to the USA. It is a manufacturing hub.
Media China, due to tight censorship, does not seem to be a hot-spot for internet businesses. It blocks Facebook, twitter - anything which can be used to organize subversion of the government.

      <description>Clay tiles  Oft turn black, collect dirt and moss. Appear to dry very fast - 12% water absorption. To avoid this, glossy or matte finish sealants are available which makes the tile less water and dirt absorbent. This sealants are re-applied every 4 to 5 years .  Cermaic  Ceramic tiles are made from natural clay that is mixed with water and molded. Creators apply a glaze to the tile to help protect it from water and scratches, then fire the clay in a kiln to harden it.</description>

      <description>Look at maximal cliques, pick a set of such cliques so that every edge is in some clique, make corresponding clique-nodes, make a tree by adding paths between cliques passing through shared-vertex-set nodes.
Eg: 1-2-3 has clique tree (1,2)-2-(2,3).
G can have multiple clique tree.
Junction tree property Take any path in the clique tree between cliques \(C_1\) and \(C_2\); then \(C_1 \inters C_2\) appears in every shared-vertex-set node inbetween them.</description>

Use Summarizing data is important for generalization, understanding future data points.
Supplying labels to unlabeled data; thence classifying new data-points. Eg: Face recognition using Eigenfaces. Use to estimate distribution support and thence in novelty detection.
Criteria: Continuity vs compactness Consider a starfish: The continuity critierion will identify the 5 arms as 5 clusters, but the comactness criterion will fail.</description>

\(Pr_{p}(a \equiv b \mod p|a \neq b) \leq n^{-1}\): num(p with \(a \equiv b mod p\) when \(b \neq a\)) or, \(num(p | (a-b)) \leq n^{-1}\) as \(a-b \in [0, 2^{n}-1]\); so \(Pr(p|a-b) &amp;lt; \frac{n}{\Pi(n^{3})} = \leq \frac{n\ln n}{n^{3}} \leq \frac{1}{n}\) Using Prime number theorem.</description>

      <description>General strategy Layer up Dressing with multiple layers of clothing essential, due to the wide use of heated buildings. It also insulates better.
Wear a warm clothing a few minutes before stepping out - then, air will be trapped inside the clothes.
Accesorize use faceguards, gloves, etc.. for extremities. This provides additional comfort. Eg: a hood not attached to the jacket provides improved mobility.
Maintenance Look for machine washable and dryable clothes.</description>

      <description>Readability techniques: Overview To borrow from, but not fully copy, &amp;ldquo;literate programming&amp;rdquo; - a code segment (say a file) should read like a clear book chapter or short wiki article. Readability (ease of understanding) can be accomplished by a combination of good variable naming, function and file size and comments - in that order of preference.
Comments are the last resort (as they get out of sync), but should be quite copious when necessary (to communicate design choices, problems, describing obscure language features etc.</description>

      <description>Interpolation See approximation theory ref.
Root finding Find \(x: f(x) = 0\).
Newton&amp;rsquo;s method Find the root iteratively. Take a local linear approximation \(g(x) = f(x_n) + \gradient f(x_n)^{T}(x-x_n)\) for \(f\), find its root; and use it as the next guess for the root.
\(x_{n+1} = x_{n} + \frac{f(x_{n})}{f&amp;rsquo;(x_{n})}\). For vector function \(f\): \(x_{n+1} = x_{n} + (\gradient(f(x_{n})))^{-1}f(x_{n})\).
This becomes the Newton&amp;rsquo;s method in optimization, when applied to solving for the optimality condition \(\gradient f(x) = 0\).</description>

  Intention: Generating the thought to be spoken in the internal language of logic.
  Generation: Translating the logical language into natural language.
  Synthesis: Speaking the generated words with appropriate stresses, accents etc..
  Speech comprehension Tasks Speech comprehension involves the following tasks:
  Perception: Translating the sounds heard or symbols seen to words or tokens; this is akin to lexical analysis by compilers.</description>

You will simply stop caring about many of the &amp;ldquo;prestige traps&amp;rdquo; that afflict our minds - what brands of clothes, shoes, phones, cars and so on and on.</description>

      <description>Machine instructions and their files Machine instructions are understood by the processor. Assembly level code provides a way to write machine instructions using words instead of hexadecimal instructions.
Executable files When an operating system is being used, machine instructions, which are stored in a file or on fixed locations in the hard-disk, should be associated with suitable meta-data/ headers. Such files are called executable files.
Object files Object files contain named segments of machine instructions - library functions.</description>

      <description>SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping) problem The objective is to localize one&amp;rsquo;s position relative to those objects. There are two important subproblems: a] object or feature detection, b] measurement of position (distance and orientation) relative to a given feature. Solution approaches depend on the available tools - which may vary with situation.
Tools and approaches Localization using bounced light from lasers is essentially a solved problem; but lasers are expensive. Localization using light detected by passive sensors (eg: visible spectrum cameras) is harder.</description>

      <description>Problems In all of the following, we suppose that \(f_X(x)\) is given by a graphical model.
Model Estimation The most ambitious goal is to estimate the parameters associated with the distribution. This can often be accomplished by minimizing the log loss associated with the conditional distribution \(f_{X_i|X_{\nbd(i)}}\), once the structure of the underlying graphical model has been estimated (ie feature selection is done).
Edge recovery Deduce the graph encoding the conditional independence relationships among features.</description>

Priority and restarts Commonly jobs dispatched by condor are low priority - so if a higher priority process comes in, the condor job is stopped and moved to a different processor. If the program has checkpointing facilites, the job simply continues from where it stopped : Eg: Compiled languages.</description>

Ask questions that require more than a simple &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; answer to subtly encourage a shy or introverted person to keep talking.
Conduct interviews. Make them talk about themselves and their work.
Be prepared - try not to ask questions which could have been answered by other means. Special questions: How did you get your job?</description>

      <description>Intro Sometimes criminals form organizations with internal rules and hierarchies. Organization may vary from loose to tight. Big criminal organizations, based on their geographic origin and organization, can be classified into Mafia (Sicily), &amp;lsquo;Ndranghetta (Calabria), Yakuza (Japan), Triad (China), Mexican cartels, Columbian cartels and others. Sometimes, as in the case of Yakuza, they are semi-open.

Tries to mimic the way people formulate convex programs: drawing from a library of convex functions, combining them in various valid ways to preserve convexity. Similarly, it has a rich, expandable library of functions with known properties, plus it specifies valid ways of composing and combining them.

It appears the the word cynosure is from the name tail of Canis Major (cynos-ura).

      <description>Motivation Data preparation often involves massaging attribute values to fit the requirements of operators/ models. For example, some operators cannot handle continuous values, others cannot handle polynomial values, some have problem with missing data.
Changing the range Ploynominal features can be converted to binomial features using a binary representation.
Binominal features can be treated as numeric inputs.
Continuous valued features can be converted to discrete valued features by binning them. The bins may be defined by a regular grid on the range, or irregularly to ensure roughly equal cardinality.</description>

      <description>Feature extraction Use some \(\ftr\): d-dim X formed by input vars \(\to\) m-dim Feature space; \(\ftr\) is a vector function. Basis of feature space are the &amp;lsquo;basis functions&amp;rsquo; \((\ftr_{i})\). \tbc
Dimensionality reduction Remove irrelevant/ less relevant features, merge duplicate features. Eg: synonymous words in documents.
Importance Treating duplicate features as if they were different harms ability to classify or cluster data points. Irrelevent features also harm predictive ability, by acting as noise.</description>

      <description>Overview, motivation Some discipline is necessary in order to avoid common errors which consume effort and resources. The below describes steps common to many problems including density estimation and classification.
Formulate the problem in decision theoretic terms properly - pick an appropriate &amp;lsquo;risk/ loss function&amp;rsquo; (possibly incorporating prior belief), a candidate feature set. Then fix a model family (possibly after a literature survey) and develop a model selection procedure. Then use empirical risk estimation using cross validation in order to avoid overfitting to training data.</description>

      <description>The conciseness and clarity of expression of branching and iterative operation in different languages is different.
Branching The if-else structure is the most basic decision structure, using which more convenient decision structures like the if-elseif.. structure is defined.
Matching a value Different branches of execution often depend on different tests performed over the value of an expression. This is provided in terms of the ’match with various cases’ construct.
Iterative operations The essential ingredients of an iteration are the starting state, the code to be executed and the termination condition.</description>

      <description>Certain elements common to probability density estimation, distribution structure learning (including classification) etc.. can be studied within the abstract framework of decision theory.
Agents: Actions, policies How should an agent act in the face of uncertainty, given some observations? Our objective is to find good decision procedures for the agent.
Like a game against nature. See game theory reference for adversarial games.
State and parameters State space The state of nature changes, possibly in response to actions made by an agent.</description>

      <description>Decision lists Decision list is fully specified by a sequence of \(k\) variables \((x_{i})\) and outputs \(r(x_{i}), r&amp;rsquo;(x_k)\). It is like an &amp;lsquo;if .. elseif .. elseif .. else&amp;rsquo; statement. It can be visualised as a chain of variables, each with one outgoing edges representing an output.
In a d-decision list, \(d-CNF\)&amp;rsquo;s are used in place of \(\set{x_i}\).
Generality This can be writ as halfspace: \(sign(\sum 2^{k-i}x_{i}o(x_{i}))\).
We can write conjunctions, disjunctions as decision lists.</description>

      <description>Every person has some noble and some ignoble qualities. What makes a hero? A hero is a person, who may be flawed, but persistently develops and displays (personally and socially) noble traits, and does great deeds.
Heroes do not function in a vaccum: rather, they are able achieve their deeds building upon the deeds of others, and only due to cooperation and help from others. Of course, one should remember that the traits themselves should be the focus of admiration, and one should not descend to chauvinism which tries to deny unpleasent truths about these people.</description>

      <description>Decompositional approach Easy to analyze stability. Can reuse decomposition to solve multiple instances of the problem: eg consider A = LU.
Condition number of a matrix Condition number of Ax when x perturbed \(k = \sup_{\change x} \frac{\norm{A\change x}}{\norm{\change x}}\frac{\norm{x}}{\norm{Ax}} = \norm{A}\frac{\norm{x}}{\norm{Ax}} \leq \norm{A}\norm{A^{-1}}\) or \(\leq \norm{A}\norm{A^{+}}\) if A not square.
So, condition of \(A^{-1}b\) when b perturbed, \(k = \norm{A^{-1}}\frac{\norm{Ax}}{\norm{x}} \leq \norm{A}\norm{A^{-1}}\).
Condition number of matrix wrt norm \(k(A) = \norm{A}\norm{A^{-1}}\).</description>

      <description>Importance Fitting a model to observations, ie picking a probability distribution from a family of distributions, is an important component of many statistics tasks where one reasons about uncertainty by explicitly using probability theory. Such tasks are labeled &amp;lsquo;Bayesian inference&amp;rsquo;.
Choosing the distribution family Observe empirical distribution Draw a bar graph, see what the curve looks like.
Given expected values of fns \( \set{E[\ftr_{i(X)}] = \mean_{i} } \) and a base measure h Suppose we want to modify h as little as possible, under KL divergence, so that it has \(E[\ftr(X)] = \mean\).</description>

Devise rand alg which uses n 2-wise ind bits; enumerate all values for \(\log n\) truly ind bits, make n 2-wise ind bits and run rand alg.
Explicit construction algorithms Sample values for some variables, show that desired object still exists, use exhaustive search for other variables.</description>

      <description>Build Targets A programmer may want to do certain specific actions with his code.
For example, downloading dependencies for being able to compile, compiling code, running test cases, running the code, packaging the code, deploying a package on a web-server. These actions are called build targets.
Continuous mode With some dependencies, one can execute a specific action while constantly scanning for source code changes..
Target Dependencies There may be various dependencies amongst these build targets.</description>

      <description>By designing action systems By specifying the safety and progress properties the distributed computation should have, you can then design a compliant action system. Then you can refine this in various ways to get different looking implementations.
Coordinating processes There is always an initiator process.
General signalling constructs See programming ref. Callback, polling.
Synchronization Blocking Process A may be listening in the channel, and may be blocked until it receives a message.</description>

      <description>Conformity, collectivism They have been a culture with a high emphasis on conformity: it is important not to stand out - either in good or bad ways, unless the social role requires it.
People often think about what others think about them. Social honor is a big component of individual honor. In old days, some people were driven to commit suicide by hAra-kiri stoically as a matter of punishment or grief over shame.</description>

      <description>Definition Rate of change The differential function, aka derivative, is \
\(f&amp;rsquo;(x) = \frac{df}{dx}= \lim_{\change x \to 0} \frac{f(x+\change x) - f(x)}{\change x}\), if the limit exists.
Linear approximation view Hence, \(f(x + \change x) = f(x) + \change(x) f&amp;rsquo;(x)\), as \(\change x \to 0\). As the primary use of the differential function is to be able to make linear/ polynomial approximations to \(f\), one can view the differntial function as a measure of \(f(x + \change x) - f(x)\) as \(\change x \to 0\).</description>

      <description>Definition Fixed direction differential fn Aka directional derivative.
Fixing the direction \(v\), \(D_v(f)\) can be taken to map \(x\) to \(D_v(f)(x)\). So, \(D_v(f)(x): V \to F\) is a constricted version of the differential function \(D(f)(x)\).
\(df(x; h) = D_h(f)(x)= \lim_{\change t \to 0} \frac{f(x+\change th) - f(x)}{\change t} = \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}f(x + th)\). Aka Gateaux differential.
Alternate notation: \(\gradient_{h}(f(x)) \) : not the gradient vector, but its applicaiton in a certain direction.</description>

      <description>General motivations Perhaps one wants to find closest vectors to a given vector - perhaps for the purpose of executing the nearest neighbor algorithm.
Computational efficiency - as in the case of Most variable subspace identification (PCA).
Noise reduction - it could be that many of the features in a vector are not very informative.
Latent factor modeling Problem Here, one derives generative models to describe affinity of one discrete variable (say \(U\)) with another (say \(V\)): eg: features and objects, documents and words.</description>

      <description>Display screens Liquid Crystal displays tend to be more ergonomically friendly than CRT tube monitors.
Quality Image quality Display screens vary in image quality parameters: screen size, maximum resolution: SVGA (800 x 600), XGA (1024 x 768), SXGA (1280 x 1024), or UXGA (1600 x 1200), contrast ratio.
They also vary in refresh rate, in the case of images generated from projection, as in CRT monitors or projectors: low refresh rate results in flicker and eye strain - especially from typing distance.</description>

      <description>Retail vs wholesale Retail business focuses on distributing goods to consumers, while making a profit. Wholesalers focus on selling goods in bulk at a lower price to other businesses and distributors. Eg in USA: Sam’s club, costco. In India: Metro.
Price discrimination Different people are willing to pay different prices for the same product, and retailers try to exploit this.
In general, retailers try to distinguish the two types of customers by offering lower prices only to those who participate in some undesirable process which costs extra time and attention- eg: waiting for a certain day to make a purchase, committing to purchase in advance, gathering coupons.</description>

      <description>Domain name To connect to an application on a remote computer, one needs to know the IP address of that computer, which is often supplied to the application externally - by a user for example. Strings, called domain names, tend to be easier to remember than IP addresses.
Translation So domain name resolution can be considered a sub-module used for translating domain names to IP addresses.

Feature extraction Document is a string of words; but want a simpler representation.
Maybe just the set of words which appear is most important: use word-counts. Maybe number of occurances is also important.
Burstiness First time a word appears, it is very informative; but its second occurance is much less surprising/ informative.</description>

Bleeding controlled via compression. Do not apply chilly/ghee/mud/milk/turmeric or basically anything on the wound. You need to avoid tetanus and rabies Wash the wound thoroughly under tap water (for 2 hours some say) with copious amounts of soaps. Rabies virus (and, those of its Lyssavirus genus) are sensitive to soap.</description>

In its essence it’s animism – spirits (numina) were connected with all things, beings and acts of people. In Roman animism every being, thing, activity or idea had their divine character and meaning.

      <description>Intro  Fault current is best sent to ground. This includes surge current and lightening current.  Structure  An electrode is stuck in a pit in the ground and fault current is directed to it. The ground should have low resistivity at all times. But ground resistivity varies with space and season. So, electroloytes are added. With regular earthing, salt and coal is added around the electrode. Salt dissipates gradually and increases conductivity in the surrounding ground.</description>

      <description>With almost an year passing since the Great Fall we reflect upon him who acquired “eko mAnuSha AnandaH” that is alluded to in the texts. He lived once upon a time beside the swamp with snakes and crocodilians in it. He was of immense intelligence and physical abilities, and he was capable of performing complex rites. He was set on the path of knowing the truth. He was recognized for his speed and agility and was recruited amongst the able ones.</description>

      <description>ACH With ACH (Automatic clearing house), money transfer between banks is done electronically within a given country. They are commonly used to process direct deposits etc.. To use ACH, one needs to know the routing numbers/ ABA codes and the account numbers for the source and destination accounts.
Reversal/ availability The payer’s bank also has the right to reverse the transfer within a few days (5 in USA) - so funds may not be immediately available for withdrawal.</description>

      <description>A meat base  The main reason a Carnivore Diet heals is that it cuts out all food sensitivities in the diet, not that all non-ASF (animal sourced food) is bad. People who have a wide sensitivity to plants benefit because it cuts out all potential food triggers. Meat is the least problematic food group. Carnivory works to reduce inflammation, autoimmune conditions and gut issues. Essentially, only eating meat is an elimination diet – and elimination diets work.</description>

Formulation as matrix factorization (Shconberg). Take weighted adj matrix W. \(W_{i,j} = \norm{x_{i}-x_{j}}^{2} = x_{i}^{T}x_{i} + x_{j}^{T}x_{j} - 2x_{i}^{T}x_{j}\). Take \(X = (x_{i})\); Gram matrix \(G = X^{T}X\) normalized to have \(g_{i,i} = 1\); then \(W = 2.11^{T}-2G\). Then solve for G; then solve \(G = X^{T}X\) for X with min number of columns.

      <description>Many years ago when we were yapping away on the then latest production of the socialist academic Jared Diamond, Guns Germs Steel Blah blah, we turned our attention to two historical incidents which were reasonably faithfully described by him. One was the destruction of the Native South Americans by the Spanish conquistadors and the other was the cannibalizing of one Austronesian tribe the Moriori by another the Maori. Given his Marxist bent it is not at all surprising that he went on to equate the two events, and try to explain them through his universalist view of geographic contingency, which he repeats ad nauseum in that long-winding tome.</description>

      <description>An important lesson is there to be learnt from what happened between 1795 to 1818 vis-a-vis the Maharattas. Bajirao II handed himself up to British protection as he was in conflict with Daulatrao Shinde. Shinde was in turn in locked in enemity with Yashvant and Vithoji Holkar and the other major Maharatta chiefs like Gaikwad in Gujarat and Bhosle of Nagpur. Vithoji Holkar was given to banditry and he began large scale thievery and raiding along with his Pendharis north of the Krishna river.</description>

      <description>The enemy forces did not strike on front #1 as we had expected. Our spies inform us that they have decided to instead pause futher hostilities on front #1 and instead resort to the Trojan horse strategy. In our “Gaugamela”, which was in a month of blazing heat we had fallen prey to that strategy and lost terribly. We, however, learnt our lesson, even if it came at a high cost.</description>

      <description>References: bioarxiv , MT
Jomon and Ainu Observations The earlier peoples of Japan, the Jomon, were ancestors of the Ainu some of whom even today retain that Jomon ancestry in an unadulterated form. This Jomon-type ancestry is also seen elsewhere in east Asia like: 1. The Ulchi who live in eastern Russia &amp;amp; speak a Tungusic language. 2) They show relationship to the ancient Devils Gate people of Sikhote-Alin mountains of Russia who also show a similar admixture with the Jomon-like component as the Ulchi; 3) the ancient Hòabìnhian hunter gatherers of Vietnam also show some of this Jomon-Ainu like ancestry.</description>

      <description>Via shrIdhara vembu: When Japan went from poverty to be a leading industrial power, they let export surpluses pile up. Why is that a problem? Isn&amp;rsquo;t too much of a good thing a better thing? Such massive export surpluses have two issues, a) financial and b) real economy.
Happiness and demographics Now the real economy effect of piling up export surpluses. Japan then (and broader East Asia now) developed what I call &amp;ldquo;over-employment&amp;rdquo; - my term for an obsessive focus on putting everyone to work.</description>

Choices Buy some light safety glasses which fit over prescription eye-glasses, with either smoke or yellow tinted lenses. Sunglasses should ideally cover the entire visual range where the sun strikes the eyes: even the top. For this reason, clip-on sunglasses are inadequate.</description>

      <description>Fiber can be soluble and insoluble. Insoluble fibers aid bowel movement.
Soluble fiber helps reduce cholesterol, reduces sugar response after eating, normalizes blood lipid levels. Soluble fiber is not broken down until it reaches the large intestine where digestion causes gas (flatulence). In excessive amounts, soluble fiber causes high flatulance, cramps.
Fibers in legumes, such as peanuts, beans is mostly soluble fibers.
Tree Nuts have insoluble fibers.</description>

      <description>In the year of dvAdashAnta, MP found every neuron in his brain captured by R. I believe every waking and perhaps non-waking hour of the day he was only occupied by R. In the company of other males he spoke only of R and how he may impress her. On what he thought to be the day of reckoning, our duhitaram kalashaja non-chalantly asked MP whether some eight-carbon ring with alternating double bonds will be an acid or a base.</description>

      <description>The entire database may be stored within a single file. Such databases may be useful when a database server is not required and when access is local. Eg: sqlite, berkeley db (not a relational db), recutils.
sqlite  sqlite3 databases cannot be opened with sqlite. sqlite offers a limited set of field types. sqlite does not allow joins during updates - making the process of copying columns a bigger chore.  GUI sqlitebrowser offers a good GUI for sqlite - but the import from csv feature is very slow as of 2012.</description>

Artificial production Research is on to produce meat in-vitro.
Demand and supply Past The discovery of agriculture enabled mass, reliable food production. For most of history, we have had a food surplus. When there was a famine in one country, one could rely on imports from another.

      <description>Sources: sentona97  Motivations  Openness: For Romans, deities were ones who had to serve their purpose. If the purpose wasn’t served even if you gave sacrifices, they would try their luck from another deity or the manifestation of the same deity. This is one of the reasons why many foreign deities and cults were popular. Romans would also implement deities of people they were in war with. This was done in order to attract deities on their side, so they can leave their enemies and be victorious.</description>

      <description>Procedures Code is often organized into different procedures, which may be invoked under different contexts with different arguments.
Mathematical functions A procedure can change state (has a side-effect) and maybe return a value, doesn’t naturally correspond to mathematical function which cannot do this. So a function, which cannot have side-effects, can be viewed as a special type of procedure.
C is a procedural programming language which is not structured.
Passing arguments to procedures Variables can be passed by reference, or by value.</description>

Launch Then, they pitch it to venture capitalists who provide two rounds of funding in return for a share in the company.
Expansion A third round of funding, called the mezzannine funding, is then sought for a possible expansion phase, usually after the company is profitable.</description>

Index funds for a given economic sector simply invest in major companies in proportion to their market value. One relys on the less riskier supposition that the entire sector is likely to grow, rather than any single security belonging to that sector.</description>

      <description>We invested today in some heavy duty diplomatic negotiations in the hope that we may strengthen our hand for the impending battle. The negotiations went off well but we cannot be lulled into security because the enemy too is possibly using this as a ploy to obtain a dependable escape route if they are pressed hard. Funnily the situation is somewhat like Iraq (them) and the USA (us). On the occassions we smashed them, we gained little, but their constant assaults have a tremendous nuisance value.</description>

      <description>We tested out a few maneuvers directly in enemy territory and we found things held pretty well. We also spied a long but interesting attack route that would carry us straight to the ground of the initial encounter.

      <description>Anticipated trade One agent makes a deal with another to buy a certain amount of an ’underlying’ security on a specified future date at a certain ’strike’ price. To satisfy this deal, the seller is obliged to buy the security - if he does not already hold it - on or before the due-date.
Motivation The seller is betting that the market price of the security on or before the due-date will be lower than the set price; and the buyer is betting that the market price will exceed the set-price on or after the due-date.</description>

y is called the bet liability.
Viability of the bet Rational B (who is not risk-averse) will enter the contract if according to his evaluation of a, a__x − (1 − a)y ≥ 0 or $a \geq \frac{y}{x+y}$.</description>

      <description>There were the two players of Tetris who were known as Wump and Tump. They Wump and Tump were good each playing at their respective level. But obviously one was better than the other. My strI finally gave me a hint of which level I was at. I feared I was the worst of the pack but in the least there were others worse than me. So assuming that my kAmikA was right, may be I do play at a reasonable level.</description>

      <description>Background  My and Ramya&amp;rsquo;s parents come from a background where monthly salary was the only source of income and was sufficient to take care of food, shelter and education. Travel was limited to summer vacation to grandparents home. But that life was very enjoyable. Lots of family time was the foundation stone.  Transition  When we both started earning. We were clearly products of an education that focussed of employability.</description>

      <description>Associative nature of thought Thought about a certain concept is influenced strongly by (possibly weak) associations with other concepts.
Physiological reason Neurons which fire together wire together - they are highly social. Nature of human thought is associative.
Examples People, when asked to think about the past or future, tend to lean slightly back or forward. People when exposed to a crossword with polite words tend to exhibit more polite behavior.</description>

      <description>Random bit generator is usually a physical device. Usually, \(Pr(X = 1) = p\); from this, easily get random generator with \(Pr(X = 1) = 1/2\): flip every alternate bit. Flippling every t-th bit, get Pr(X = 1) = 1/t.
2-wise independent bits generation \(2^{b}-1\) 2-ind bits \(Y_{i}\) from b ind bits \(X_{i}\): For each subset, \(Y_{i}=\oplus X_{i}\). In GF(p), p 2-ind elements from 2 ind elements: \(Y_{i}=(X_{1}+iX_{2}) \mod p\) for every i in GF(p).</description>

      <description>Recombinant DNA technology This is a cumbersome method of modification whereby gene fragments from one organism are inserted into vectors such as bacterial plasmids or viruses, which can then transfer them into the organism of interest. Though this technology had early successes in the 1970’s, its application was constrained due to limitations in scope and scale.

      <description>Proper pramANa-s 
The above is from [Nature16].
 &amp;ldquo;First, a paper from 2006 is wildly out of date for this field. The methods used have been superseded. Instead of using one locus, the Y chromosome, and focusing on microsatellites (which have upsides and downsides), researchers now look at the whole genome.&amp;rdquo; RK15 &amp;ldquo;Dr. Underhill says there is no comparison between the kind of data available in 2010 and now. “Then, it was like looking into a darkened room from the outside through a keyhole with a little torch in hand; you could see some corners but not all, and not the whole picture.</description>

      <description>The Georgians don&amp;rsquo;t speak an IE language.  Early religion  &amp;ldquo;But what was their natural religion before being smothered by the evils of pretonmAda? The evidence from the victory announcements of the preta-s suggest that they were following the natural more eastern reflex of Iranian religion. So in a sense they are a parallel the Dravidians of India: different language family but same religion as their Arya neighbors. However, there are hints that there might have been an internal clash between Georgians who initially worshipped a more natural flavor of the Iranian religion &amp;amp; the Zoroastrians who insisted on uniconic worship.</description>

      <description>Properties  Bond/ peel strength  Solvents  White glue also contains water. Water acts as a solvent that keeps the glue liquid until you want it to stick. When you put glue on a piece of paper, the solvent — water — is exposed to air. The water eventually evaporates. As the water evaporates, the glue dries and hardens. All that&amp;rsquo;s left are the sticky polymers that hold things together.</description>

      <description>Importance of planning An individual earns money from employment when young and healthy; but eventually they retire or get sick- either early or after going old.
Many expenses are very predictable. Hence set up a retirement fund, children’s education fund, health/ emergency fund. Many people fail at doing this.
Goals Investment horizon and age One should be clear about the investment horizon: when does one intend to withdraw money from the fund, with what frequency etc.</description>

      <description>Overview In roughly descending order of importance:
 Easy to understand. Easy to modify. Few errors. High coding speed. High computational efficiency.  Understanding specifications In the industry, this involves surveying customers, rapid prototyping, talking to end-users etc.. In research, the specifications come from the research problem.
Complexity More complex code is harder to implement : sometimes, there one can make choices which lead to simpler code - by simplifying requirements or interface languages for example.</description>

      <description>Google docs Cell referencing Columns are numbered with letters and rows with numbers. A cell can be specified using a latter and a number.
When cell references are copied (perhaps as part of formulae), the references may be automatically changed in a certain way - this is called relative reference: Eg: The reference A20 used in cell A2, when copied to B2 will automatically be changed to B20.
When such change does not happen, we have absolute reference to a cell.</description>

      <description>GPU&amp;rsquo;s, implementing common graphics tasks on specialized circuits, speed up display tasks involved in personal computing.
High data parallelism GPU&amp;rsquo;s follow a dataflow architecture: Highly pipelined, parallel with many small cores - much more than CPU&amp;rsquo;s. Usually, these parallel cores are divided profitably and easily: Like one core for a bunch of pixels.
Earlier these processing elements were specialized for graphics, now these shaders are more programmable.
For general computing With GPGPU, one would Disguise program as geometry computation.</description>

Depopulation (SP15, BVP15)  Emperor Augustus would introduce legislation to increase the birthrates of the Roman nobility.    Etruscans  Fortunately, recent advances in the field of archaeo-genetics have managed to clear up the situation somewhat. Showing us that while the mitochondrial DNA of ‘Etruscan’ remains may indeed tend to tether them to the pre-Indo-European populations of the neolithic (something that had generated some excitement amidst those claiming the Etruscans as a Basque-style ‘Isolate’) … the Y-chromosome analysis suggested a rather more familiarly Indo-European descent was salient.</description>

      <description>Water table  Ground water is simply the subsurface water that fully saturates pores or cracks in soils and rocks. This water is consumed by evaporation, plants and human pumping, and is recharged by precipitation. Below the ground, at a certain level is the &amp;ldquo;saturated zone&amp;rdquo;. This is generally close to the level of water in a nearby surface water body. Above it is the &amp;ldquo;unsaturated zone&amp;rdquo;. In this unsaturated zone, there usually is at least a little water, mostly in smaller openings of the soil and rock; the larger openings usually contain air instead of water.</description>

      <description>The most common graphical user interfaces use the desktop/ workspace and the windows metaphor.
Desktop A desktop/ workspace corresponds to a big area in the available screen space whence applications are launched, and within which statuses, widgets and windows are displayed.
There may be multiple workspaces on a device - especially in case of devices with limited screen size.
Layering Various windows, widgets and the desktop conceptually form a stack of various displays available to the user.</description>

  Windowing system: provides abstraction from hardware, provides graphics primitives, basic window drawing abilities. Eg: xorg server.
  Login session manager. Enables selection of desktop environment. Eg: gdm, kdm, lxdm, simpledm.
  Desktop environment. Eg: gnome, kde (programmed with widgeting toolkits gtk+ and qt respectively). application ivocation: mouse driven or keyboard driven (possibly with autocompletion).</description>

As they were neither Muslim, Christian, Jewish or Magian, the caliph told them they were non-believers. He said they would have to become Muslims, or adherents of one of the other religions recognized by the Qur&amp;rsquo;an by the time he returned from his campaign against the Byzantines or he would kill them.</description>

Along with the money, he usually specifies something like a password that will lead to the money being paid out (blue arrows). The hawa calls another hawala broker M in the recipient&amp;rsquo;s city, and informs M about the agreed password, or gives other disposition of the funds.</description>

      <description>Hayastanika is known as sarvapriyA and mahAsurApipAnA. Thus, we mused over the turn of the chakra known as the saMvatsara. The wheel turned and sharadaH had come resulting in the dismal air that hangs over us. We decided to stay away from lalAmI and enjoy the pleasant company of Kappa, which was like a madhu-chaShaka in itself. We saw the movie sukhAvati of Campbell and then began discussing a hero with a 1000 faces.</description>

      <description>Ocean pollution composition Thermoplastics amount to well over 95% of all plastic found during ocean studies. Polyurethanes, however, account for less than 2% of all waste detected during ocean surveys. Thermoplastics, with their weak inter-strand bonds, produce microplastics.
Synthetic fibres to make up a good share of microplastics found in waters. In fact, it’s been suggested that more than 4,500 fibres can be released per gram of clothing per wash, according to the Plastic Soup Foundation.</description>

      <description>Another point I shall consider is the role of the great goddess Hekate in Neoplatonic thought. Hekate in Neoplatonism plays a strikingly parallel role to mAyA in uttaramImAMsa and prakR^iti in sAMkhya. She is described in the Chaldaean oracles to have emerged from the “primary entity/being” (the Neoplatonic equivalent of puruSha or brahman) and separates the two “fires”- the “purely intellectual fire” that belongs to the primary entity/being and the material fire from which the cosmos arises.</description>

      <description>Early separation  Now, the Hittites (and other IE Anatolians - Luwians, Lycians, Lydians, etc.) basically branched off the PIE quite early : so much so that their linguistic family stands out from the other IE branches due to how archaic it is in various grammatical etc. developments.
Hittites had already made it to Anatolia and were working their way across there, invading and conquering Hurrian etc. non-IE groups as they set up their empire.</description>

      <description>As Polynomials Homogenous Forms refer to homogenous polynomials of degree k. They can be viwed as \(f:V^{k} \to F\).
They can be written as Tensor vector products, as in the case of quadratic forms.
Importance Differential functions of order \(k\) are actually homogenous forms.
Quadratic form Representation \(x^{*}Bx = \sum_{i,j} B_{i,j}x_{i}x_{j}\).
Reformulation: \(tr(x^{}Bx) = tr(Bxx^{})\).
Symmetrification If \(x^{}Bx \in R\): As \(B = H+ H&amp;rsquo; = \frac{B+B^{}}{2} + \frac{B-B^{}}{2}\), skew hermitian part can be ignored: \(x^{}Bx = x^{*}Hx\).</description>

      <description>Immuno-compromised folks Cancer patients and those who have a compromised immune system keep shedding viruses for long. Example: a cancer patient who had chemotherapy kept shedding virus till 105 days( 3 months) despite twice being titrated with Remdesivir and plasma therapy.
In internal organs The virus can persist in various internal organs.The gastrointestinal system is a good nidus for this virus. The biopsy of the gut from asymptomatic infected patients 3 months later showed persistence of the virus in the gut.</description>

      <description>The Hun Khanates starting from Shanyu Motun Tegin (probably originally pronounced as Shanyu Bagā’tur) learned the steppe Indo-Iranian style mobile warfare and made it a mechanism that allowed the Altaic people to overthrow the steppe Iranians and seize their steppe lands for themselves. They were able deploy this mode of warfare effectively on the Han Chinese empire and established a system where mobile steppe warriors could defeat much larger armies raised by sedentary populations.</description>

      <description>Notation Let us revise and adopt the following notations: b is the number of offspring per generation per individual of the parent generation, d is probability of death of an individual per generation and hence R = 1 + b − d. With this notation,the model we described in the class which accounts for reduced resources with increased population has the form \(R= R_0 (1−N_t/K)\) and hence, \(N_{t+1} = R_0 N_t(1 − N_t/K)\).</description>

      <description>Model selection given 2 models Aka Confirmatory data analysis: Test hypotheses, as against Exploratory data analysis: Find hypotheses worth testing.
Which process is more likely to have generated the data? Which model is better at explaining the observations? Model selection, with only 2 models.
Hypotheses Null hypothesis \(H_{0}: t = t_{0}\) or \(t\leq t_{0}\)
Alternate hypothesis \(H_{a}\); can be 1 sided like \(t &amp;gt; t_{a}\) or 2 sided: \(t \neq t_{0}\) or \(|t-t_{0}| \geq k\).</description>

      <description>We sat on the edge of the crater of sorrow, defeat and destruction, which was much like the crater of a great volcano, with the inferal interiors obscured by pumice and granite. We saw many yakShIs, apsaras, pishAchis and rAkShasis pass by in silence. We were haunted by the memories of the fierce battle at the pAShaNDa hill in our native land in 2003. It was a demon-haunted world into which we had slipped after that battle.</description>

Beside her sits her fair daughter rakta-jyeShThA or upa-dhUmrA. Her pArshadhas are yelling hideous statements like without shivA, shiva is but a shava.</description>

      <description>bhR^igu, the founder of our race, had said that food was brahman. In that quest we set out to the city center. They say no journey in the company of a true friend is ever long. They say no wait in the company of a comely and amiable young woman is too long. But a journey in the company of a false friend or even the briefest wait in the company of a rAkShasi-like woman is a passage through naraka.</description>

The great patriot Lokamanya Tilak who had discovered ancient evolutionary connections between the Shinto pantheon and that of the Indo-Europeans tacitly admitted that Hindus may learn from the uShAputra-s. Some of his followers even went to Japan to study their ways. With that things had come a full circle, over 1200 years ago the emperor Shomu had personally welcomed a bharadvAja brAhmaNa from Southern India who performed the installations of indra, sarasvatI and others.</description>

Green consumption People might want to similarly enhance status among environmentally conscious people by making conspicuous green choices - even though a less conspicuous investment may have benefited the ecosystem more. Eg: Installing solar panels on street side of the house, Buying the distinctive Toyota Prius rather than other inconspicuous hybrid vehicles around 2010’s.</description>

      <description>The Indo-Aryans of the second millenium Middle East have been a topic of continuing interest highlighted beginning with the works of Johannes Friedrich in 1929. Subsequently, Mironov and PE Dumont have also expanded upon this subject. These studies are of key importance to the Aryan problem, which may be briefly described as the question of time and place of origin of the Indo-Aryan languages of India and its speakers. In my opinion the traces of Indo-Aryan in the Middle East are indisputable; however, it is clear that only words and no complete Indo-Aryan language surives in these regions.</description>

      <description>Indo-Aryans have heavily influenced the world by way to the movements of their genes, languages and culture. Let us compare some of these movements to understand their dynamics.
1) The invasion of the Indian sub-continent: After breaking away from the Balto-Slavic with which they are unified by the synapomorphies such as the Satem state and the classical RUKI rule the Indo-Iranian stem developed a distinctive culture for a period in the Eurasian grassland and its northern border zones.</description>

      <description>Here we only consider inference by sampling. Inference techniques particular to various model classes are considered elsewhere.
Inference problems Find Pr(X=x) or \(Pr(X=x|Y=y)\). Inference algorithms may be exact or approximate.
Or find E[X] or \(E[X|Y=y]\).
Or find the mode of \(Pr(X=x|Y=y)\): as done in case of Maximum likelihood estimation.
Difficulty in calculating Pr(X=x) Pr(X=x) can be difficult to calculate analytically. One could specify \(Pr(X=x) = Z^{-1}f(x)\) by leaving the normalization constant Z unspecified, and describing only \(f(x)\).</description>

      <description>Proving validity of theorems We are given a set of axioms and valid statements/ additional rules of inference \(S = \set{s_i}\). Does \(S \implies^{*} p\)? Or is \(p \equiv q\)? So, want to see if a certain relationship between propositions holds.
This is akin to the search for proofs.
Use rules of inference Eg: Modus ponens: \((p \land (p \implies q)) \implies q\). Strengthening and weakening of implications.
De Morgan law: \(\lnot(p \land q) \equiv \lnot p \lor \lnot q\).</description>

      <description>Self Information of an event Aka surprisal. Measure of information content associated with event e: rarer the event, more the info, and in case of independence \(\perp(e, f): h(e, f) = h(e)+h(f)\). In the latter case, Pr(e,f) = Pr(e)Pr(f); thence get derivation: \(h(e) = h(X=x) = \log (\frac{1}{Pr(e)})\).
As code-length for recording event Coding problem Suppose that we wanted to record information that an event occurred, but we wanted to use as few bits in expectation as possible.</description>

      <description>Securities Exchanges Stock markets provide a regulated/ facilitated environment for carrying out securities transactions/ trades. It operates in fixed trading hours - beyond those hours, brokers may trade on their amongst themselves in extended trading hours.
Brokerages Every trade is accomplished by agents/ brokers authorized to trade in the stock market - usually on behalf of their customers. A fraction of each trade is usually collected by the stock exchange as fees.</description>

      <description>Insurance products, besides serving the main purpose of hedging to counter financial risk, often also function as investment in mutual funds.
Functioning As security This business takes advantage of the fact that risk of a particular kind (house burning down, theft, death), affects a small fraction of a population at any given time, with very high probability. So, it collects fees/ premiums from a large number of insured people, and compensates those on whom a bad event befalls.</description>

      <description>Intro  Can add or remove comprehensive coverage depending on evaluation of risk during journey. Non-commuter / pleasure cars merit lower insurance rates - especially because they travel fewer miles. Negotiation should be tried.  Insurance coverage Permissive use Insurance coverage travels with an automobile and not the driver. Therefore, it is irrelevant who was driving an automobile. Anyone you permit to use your car is covered.
It won&amp;rsquo;t apply if you loan it for work/ commercial use.</description>

      <description>Device interfaces Common standards are often used to connect a wide variety of device pairs.
Universal serial bus USB is currently most popular. USB 3 enables superior data-transfer speeds.
USB allows for a tiered star topology: so one can connect many devices to a particular device with a single usb wire branching out into many others. Power dissipation limits the extant to which this can be done.
USB Plugs USB wires have 4 (sometimes 5) terminals arranged in various shapes.</description>

      <description>Basic negotiable securities tradings actions are considered elsewhere.
Role in markets Intermediary traders buy and sell items, holding them for a short time while it changes hands between long-term investors. In doing so, they make a profit.
So, they focus strongly on the guessing and taking advantage of the motives of investors - aka front-running investors.
Liquidity, cost The benefit they provide is in bringing greater liquidity to assets, buy supplying a sea of ready purchasing and selling power.</description>

Tracking time In animals, there is the darkness-hormone, melatonin which then acts as a trigger for sleep. Increasing melatonin secretion frequency may trigger seasonal behavior like mating, change in coat etc..

AC power from the grid   Output:  AC power fed to downstream loads (computer, lights etc..) and never to other parts getting &amp;ldquo;raw power&amp;rdquo; (boiler etc..). This output is never fed to the AC input (don&amp;rsquo;t want to supply the grid or electrocute repairmen!).   Processing:  AC power, when available, is used to charge battery and to run downstream loads.</description>

      <description>Source Japan - Her first dalliance with West, by Rjrasva and Ravi
Foreword The history of the world since fourth century CE has seen the expansionist monotheistic religions from Middle East stamping out the pagan traditions in one land after another. We, Hindus, have keenly felt the result of this monotheistic Abrahamic onslaught losing more than half of our lands. A thorough reversion of Abrahamic expansion has occurred only in one land - the land of our pagan cousins, the Land of Rising Sun.</description>

      <description>Intro  Platform independence: so no direct access to memory. Object orientated approach. Memory management: Garbage collection. Compiled into bytecode which can be run everywhere using native interpreters. Due to many optimizations - such as &amp;lsquo;just in time&amp;rsquo; compilation, speed comparable with C for many applications.  Classes Important Superclasses, interfaces Serializable Implementing Serializable ensures that an object instance can be stored in a file and retrieved later.
Clonable Implementing the Cloneable interface ensures that the traits of a given object can be copied using the copy() definition.</description>

We felt like Shivaji after the great fort of Purandar was taken by the ghazis. While we sat ruing our defeat and the loss of the small but strong force sent to wrest the pa~nchakoNa and shulbArIya hala that we much desired, we wished that indra give us victory here. We knew that GS of boundless energy, the descendent of the great dIkshita, was a man who had attained eko-mAnuSha AnandaH.</description>

      <description>We heard from Jx that through the sAdhana-s his preceptor had bestowed on him he had completely repulsed the abhichAra. He was finally relieved from the flight of the crane: it was confirmed, but it had taken a severe toll on him. Most ill-effects except one on which the vairi had invested the most had been reversed. MM was considerably relieved that her mantras had rescued him. We had seen how the the siddhi of kAtyAyanI had visited MM, and later the most hallowed skanda had also visited her, so we did not doubt her abilties at all.</description>

      <description>Whenever we have executed that loop by instinct, thus far, some vighna has invariably come our way. This time again the mudgara-like blow of the trailokya-stambhinI caused us new trouble. But we received a signal to press on, undaunted. Jx who had been knocked out by the DAmarikA strike after being routed by the chIna-s, scraped the rock-bottom of his existence and fled further from bhAnu-kakSha to the township of indra-jAla.</description>

      <description>The last step had been reached. The powers of the mAnava had reached their end. Only the powers of the devas were next recourse. It is also called the setu- the bridge to the unknown loka. We had reached the end of the bridge- we stood at the door stead of the loka hidden beyond the impenetrable veil. Many fragments of thoughts crowded the brain- each having its own significance to us- we record them here for we are passing out that path, which the mAnava takes only once in his existence.</description>

      <description>General intro  LW. relation to buddhism here.  kAmi as the base entities &amp;ldquo;Yoshida Kanetomo&amp;rsquo;s formulation of Shinto in the 14-1500s has a touch of brilliance such that he can be called Japan&amp;rsquo;s Astika. He developed the idea that the buddha-s and the bodhisattva-s are not the original entities but they are merely manifestation of the kami who are the original divine entities. He also made the case that bauddha and Confucianism are merely second hand versions of Shinto with the kami as the primary pantheon being secondarily interpreted as nAstika buddha-s of chIna deities.</description>

      <description>Near Baramati lived a band of Kasar Gavlis, who sold their curds and milk in brass pots. One day they were visited by viShUchikA. They all died as a result. The vacuum was filled by a roving band of Maharatta tribals called the Bhosles. The Bhosles also took to breeding the gavlis’ cattle and trading milk and curd. They then were called the Gavlis. The original gavlis worshiped a horned buffalo deity called mhasobA.</description>

      <description>The critical time for khANDavaprastha had come. We were seeing signs of revolt. We deployed the dual saMGNYAnaM and kAmaM. We heavily rely on that. It had temporarily veiled the other party. But the true effects we will have to wait and see. We also need to spend a few days doing tarpaNaM to strI on laukIka matters (I wonder why women are so exaggerated in their mundane laukIka interests). Like the wandering yogI needing to please the gR^ihastrI or more precisely agastya maitrAvaruNi needing to pacify lopAmudra vaidharbhi.</description>

      <description>Source: Tarikh-I-Mubarak Shah by Yahya bin Ahmad Sirhindi via jayant20.
The Delhi sultanate rulers were well known for their oppressive policies towards the local Hindus. From jizya, to destruction of temples, Hindus of India had to go through a dark period during the regime of the five dynasties that ruled from Delhi and are collectively referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Delhi Sultanate.&amp;rdquo;
This was during the reign of Mubarak Shah, the second ruler of the dynasty.</description>

      <description>Liao (eastern khitan) empires.  &amp;ldquo;In their first phase the Khitans restored power of the Mongolic people through the conquest of northern China and the remnants of the Tang dynasty under their resourceful Khan Ambaqai (sinicized as Abaoji). Thus, they brought to the Mongolic world key political, administrative (e.g. the postal system) and knowledge developments that had occurred during the high-point of Chinese civilization.&amp;rdquo; [MT17] &amp;ldquo;As the Tang empire was on decline, the Khitan Mongols under their great Khan Yelü Ambagai conquered the whole of Mongolia, Korea and Northern China in 907 CE and his successors eventually made the Han of the Song a vassal state.</description>

      <description>The last hindu ruler of kAshmIra married twice (to rinchan and udayanadeva), who drove away alien invaders, but ultimately succumbed to the intrigue of shAh mIr.
Rise of rinchan Till 1320 CE, Kashmir remained unaffected from Islamic invasions. Islamic settlements started in the region after the kingdom was conquered by Zulju, a Mongol chieftain. He entered Kashmir via the Jehlum Valley. Lohara king of Kashmir Suhadeva fled to Kistwar.
Amid the chaos after Zulju left, Rinchana, a Buddhist and son of a Ladakhi chief, got Ramchandra, the Prime Minister turned Raja murdered (after entering the fort disguised as merchants) and ascended the throne.</description>

      <description>The kR^ityA made a couple of efforts at driving home the mAraNa and continues to hover around to strike again. Day after day the attacks continue without any respite and most critically they are aiming at cutting off our means of performing the appropriate mighty rites. Today like mArIcha and subAhu obstructing the rites of vishvAmitra the kR^ityA blocked some critical rites of ours. The kR^ityA faced the rebound of our rites and was grounded, but the senders had packed the ghaTotkacha module into the kR^ityA.</description>

      <description>Definition A language model models the probability of every possible string being a sentence spoken by a human.
Applications Language models are useful in speech recognition, machine translation, handwriting recognition, machine translation, speech generation, (context sensitive) spelling correction etc..
Multi-set of words model This very simple model ignores word order - a very important information. It models $Pr(w_{1:m}) = \prod Pr(w_i)$; and the parameters of this model - the word occurrence probabilities - are easily estimated; and it is known to follow the Zipf&amp;rsquo;s law, which is a heavy tailed distribution.</description>

      <description>Both declarative (rule-based) and imperative specification of document display is possible.
A document element is defined to either be a command and or an environment - which are distinguished based on the input they accept.
Common commands, environments Common commands include section, subsection, paragraph, subsubsection, title, author. Common environments include list (itemize and enumerate), tabular etc..
Templates Rules which map commands and environments to imperative display rules are collected together in templates.</description>

      <description>Forensics Police visit a crime scene, collect and record evidence. Then they speculate events which might account for the evidence - the speculation may be done by professional &amp;lsquo;profilers&amp;rsquo;.
Arrest Entrapment The aim is sometimes to prevent, rather than punish crime after the fact. Entrapment can lead to confession of plans; but it can also act as a way by which police informants encourage people, who would otherwise not be competent or coherent to do so, to plan and very nearly commit a crime.</description>

This involves many common/ separate tasks which can be implemented as separate modules, which inturn can be arranged as a stack or hierarchy of layers. For details, see software architecture survey.
Common layers are described below, with TCP/IP protocol stack as a specific common instantiation, which dominated other standards due to it being open-source.</description>

      <description>Classification noise Random noise vs Adversarial noise. Getting (x, l) instead of (x, c(x)).
Malicious noise: both x and c(x) corrupted.
Random Classification noise model Uniform noise \(\eta \leq \eta_{0} \in [0,.5)\); \(L\) given \(\eta_{0}\), also polynomial in \(\frac{1}{.5-\eta_{0}}\).
Statistical Query (SQ) learning model (Kearns). A \textbf{statistical query} (criterion, tolerance) = \((\chi, \tau)\) yields probability \(Pr_{x}(\chi)\) or \(E_{x}(\chi)\) of \(\chi\) over examples. \(\chi\) efficiently evaluatable, \(\tau\) not very tiny. \(L\) forms h using only statistical queries.</description>

The goal Let error in best fit, \(\eta = min_{c \in C} Pr(c(x) \neq l)\). Given \(\del, \eps\); get h where \(Pr(h(x) \neq l) \leq \eta + \eps\).
Underlying distribution Naught known to the algorithm about process generating data; just asking for approximately best fit or \(\eps\) approx of the \(c\) with error \(\eta\). Even same example \(s\) can have different label \(l\) at different times: this could either be because of noise/ corruption of the label or because of the underlying distribution.</description>

Approximation of private tuition The purpose of attending a lecture is to learn from the lecturer’s insights, opinions and ways of solving problems. Private tuition is far better than a lecture. But lecture exists due to lack of sufficient number of tutors. If you cannot follow what is going on, and if it is not too disruptive, ask.</description>

B cells When activated: Secrete antibodies.
 Neutralizing antibodies bind to a virus and ensure that they can&amp;rsquo;t bind to cell receptors. Non-neutralizing antibodies bind to antigens on surface of infected cells - detected by natural killer cells.

      <description>Linear Transformation Definition and Linearity Linearity \(A(ax+by) = aA(x)+bA(y)\). \(A\) called operator, from viewing vector as functions.
Mapping between vector spaces For any field \(F\), can consider linear transformations \(A: F^{n} \to F^{m}\).
Applications, examples Vector spaces can model many real world things (see vector spaces ref), even functions. In all of these, linear transformations have deep meanings.
Over function spaces: Differentiation, integration, multiplication by fixed polynomial in \(P_n\).
Geometric operations: \(Ax\).</description>

      <description>Graph G = (V, E). Every edge has this label: t(e): The time during which interaction represented by e took place. Given \(G[t_{0}, t_{0}&#39;]\) (training interval), output a list of edges not presented in it, but present in \(G[t_{1}, t_{1}&#39;]\) (testing interval). Maybe want to output top n most likely-to-appear edges.
Motivation Security. Improving organizational efficiency by going beyond official hierarchy. Inferring missing links from observed network.
Observations about link prediction Small world problem: tenuous short links exist between otherwise unrelated nodes: noise wrt to the link prediction problem.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Why were the Lithuanian heathens most successful in holding out against the Christian steamroller?&amp;rdquo; [MT16]
Thus, despite their many victories, broken by the Mongol strike and incessantly attacked by the crusades the heathen Lithuanian finally succumbed to Christianity in 1387 CE.
&amp;ldquo;The answer we present is related to the unusual archaism of their language and potentially religion. Thus, we posit that they were in many ways parallel to the Hindus.</description>

      <description>Examples include various java logging frameworks including log4j.
Requirements One is to be able to log at various levels, usually named debug, info, error etc..
Log messages should be informative and customizable: printing things like the name of the function where it originates, the class-name, the line number, the time, the log-message level etc..
Logging is to have a simple, yet expressive syntax for constructing messages.
One is to be able to set logging levels for various modules at various levels, so as to filter out relatively unimportant messages out of the log.</description>

      <description>Round off errors See the computer architecture survey&amp;rsquo;s chapters on number storage where representation accuracy and arithmetic accuracy are described. Tolerance of the problem and of the algorithm to representation error and error in basic arithmetic computations is considered later.
Underflow avoidance Sometimes, in case of computations involving multiplication and division with very small numbers (eg: probability calculation), there is the chance of underflow: a small non-0 number \(x\) may be stored as 0; which would then lead to \(0\) and \(\infty\) results during later multiplication and division.</description>

Some 90% of Malagasy vocabulary is from the language of the Ma&amp;rsquo;anyan, an indigenous group of roughly 70,000 people who live in remote inland areas of southeastern Borneo. Less than 10% of the vocabulary of the Malagasy language is from African languages (mainly Sabaki, a branch of Bantu).</description>

Mani the syncretic incarnation Mani&amp;rsquo;s (216-276/77) parents were members of the Jewish Christian Gnostic sect known as the Elcesaites.
Mani believed that the teachings of Gautama Buddha, Zoroaster, and Jesus were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the &amp;ldquo;Religion of Light&amp;rdquo;. Manichaean tradition is also noted to have claimed that Mani was the reincarnation of different religious figures such as Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, and Jesus.</description>

      <description>Process design: Productivity and quality How to transform the shop-floor/ assembly process and the procurement/ design process to increase quantity and quality?
Quality/ quantity trade-off When the focus is on quantity, quality often suffers, as workers are provided incentives and punishments which, focusing on quantity, largely ignore quality. Quality control is often postponed to a later stage.
The Toyota process, observing that correcting/ tolerating mistakes can be costly, tries to ensure that they get it right the first time - workers have the ability to stop the assembly-line in order to fix a mistake when they make/ detect it.</description>

      <description>Masi Reddi and his wife Nilamama lived in the eastern ghats selling wood with their 6 sons. They invoked mahAdeva, who appeared in their house in the form of a jangama. He gave Nilamma some ashes and said they would become rich when another son was born. This son was Undala Padmanna. Soon they became prosperous by acquiring agriculture. However Padmanna never did any work. So his brothers decided to kill him.</description>

      <description>Title: There’s more to mathematics than rigour and proofs
Author: Terrance Tao
 _The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question ‘How can we eat?’, the second by the question ‘Why do we eat?’ and the third by the question, ‘Where shall we have lunch?</description>

      <description>Approximating a matrix The problem Take set of matrices S. Want \(\argmin_{B \in S} \norm{A - B}\) is minimized wrt some \(\norm{}\) and some set S.
The error metric Also, often \(\norm{.}\) is an operator norm, as this ensures that \(\norm{(A-B)x}\) is low wrt the corresponding vector norm. Other times, as in the case of matrix completion problems, it may be desirable for \(\norm{}\) to be the Frobenius norm.
Low rank (k) factorization problem In many problems, S is the set of rank k matrices, where k is small.</description>

      <description>The yellow autumn had slipped by silently. The white cover brought with it the short days of diablerie, and the old curse of another shivarAtri passing by was apparent. A coin fell without any apparent reason, but the omen was hardly understandable. Four roads crossed at a certain point in the southern boundary of the kingdom of the Assakas of yore. On side of one of those roads was a buffalo shed and on the other the shrine of the tribal buffalo lord, Mahsoba.</description>

      <description>Important functionals Radial basis functionals \(f_{c}(x) = g(\norm{x - c})\). Gaussian radial basis function is used to define the Gaussian kernel.
Barrier functional \(f(x) \to \infty\) as \(x \to bnd(dom(f))\). Eg: \(\log (1-x)\).
Used to charactarize feasible region in optimization problems. Any set in \(R^{n}\) is the domain as a barrier function.
Kernel function k Implicitly (perhaps non-linearly) map \(x\) to \(\ftr(x)\) and give \(\dprod{x, x&amp;rsquo;}\) in that space.
Importance See kernel trick in statistics ref.</description>

      <description>Importance of decompositions Very important in restating and understanding the behavior of a linear operator. Also, important in solving problems: get decomposition, use it repeatedly. For algebraic manipulation: Factor the matrix: QR, LU, Eigenvalue decomposition, SVD.
EW revealing decompositions See section on eigenvalues.
Eigenvalue decomposition Aka Spectral Decomp. Only if \(A\) diagonalizable.
Take \(S\): Eigenvectors-as-columns matrix, with independent columns; \(\EW\): Eigenvalue diagonal matrix. Then, AS = SL; So, \(S^{-1}AS = L\); \(A=SLS^{-1}\): a similarity transformation.</description>

Determinant of square A Definitions Det(A) or \(|A|\) : The recursive defn. Cofactor of \(A_{1,1}\): \(C_{1,1}\) = det of submatrix (minor) of A. Defn by properties: 1: det I = 1. 2: If 2 rows are equal, det(A) = 0. 3: det \(A\) depends linearly on first row.
Properties So, there is sign change in Det(A) with row exchanges. Also, Det(A) is unchanged with \(row_{1} += k row_{2}\).</description>

      <description>Mistake bound (MB) learning model Problem \(L\) learns \(C\): \(L\) given sample point \(x\), returns h(x), told if it is correct; this is repeated; has mistake bound \(m\) (over any sequence of examples).
Adversarial nature and randomization The mistake bounded model is adversarial in nature - we are concerned with the number of mistakes made in the worst case. So, randomization helps : the adversary decides on the input before the coin is tossed, so not knowing the algorithm&amp;rsquo;s output, its attempts to cause mistakes are less successful.</description>

      <description>Model/ hypothesize for predictive ability Many natural phenomena are not deterministic. We often want concise explanations for observed phenomena. This will grant us great predictive ability. Probability theory aims to model and understand uncertainties such phenomena.
Realism vs conciseness The more the model reflects reality, the better it is. Yet, as we want to avoid overfitting to limited data, we seek conciseness.
So, the art here is to define more and more general/ concise models, which also manage to model reality closely, whose parameters turn out to be easy to learn in practice.</description>

      <description>Intro  Aka Talaing, Peguans, Raman (ရာမန်) from pALi Rāmañña(ရာမည)-desha, their heartland in burmese coast. The Tailang name suggests that they may have had some Indian Telanga ancestry. The Mon adapted pallava alphabet.  Religion  They became theravAda bauddha-s.  Spirit cult  &amp;ldquo;Other than language, the most distinctive cultural characteristic of the Mons was the spirit cult. Halliday said that one of the distinguishiug marks of a Mon, without which one could not be a Mon, was interest in house spirits.</description>

      <description>From GangFit 3 by Mark Baker/ GuruAnaerobic:
 There are 2 types of individual who trade freedom for money.
1 The employed (millions of these). They spend all their weekdays working for money. They earn money so they can pay bills and feel free at the weekend
2 The individual who is never satisfied - they want more money. The business owner/megarich, entrepreneur, wanker, etc. They are boring show-offs and even more boring company; they only talk about making money.</description>

      <description>Convergent sequences \((s_{n), (t_{n})\) in a field Also see Topology ref, properties noted in lin alg ref.
Sums, products, quotients (sans 0 denominator) of convergent sequences are convergent.
Boundedness Upper and lower bounds.
Montonicity Monotone increasing and decreasing sequences.
A monotone increasing sequence that is bounded above must converge: imagine points on real line; similarly monotone decreasing sequence that is bounded below.
(Bolzano, Weierstrass): Every bounded sequence has a subsequence which converges: let M be the bound; either [-M, 0] or [0, M] has \(\infty\) elements; so use this repeatedly to find monotone, bounded subsequence; this converges.</description>

      <description>Hua 華 This character is a self-designation of the Chinese both internally and abroad, e.g. the Chinese minority in Vietnam is known as the Hoa. Its basic meaning is “civilized, elite” (apart from “flower”, with the same character), the opposite meaning of “barbarian”. The Chinese do indeed consider themselves as the civilized ones, as distinct from the barbarians. Hua is unapologetic in its claim to superiority.
Zhong, “middle”, from Zhongguo, “the Middle Kingdom, China”.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t let it happen. Profile the seller. &amp;ldquo;Is he take it or leave it? Or desparate to make sales (eg. poor street seller)? Is there going to be a recurring relationship or is it a one-off transaction?&amp;rdquo; Understand the desperate seller&amp;rsquo;s motivations:  Upsell goods (coerce purchase of undesired/ more goods).</description>

      <description>Brain construction Wiring and insulation Brain is has a lot of many armed cells called neurons (grey matter). Using these arms (axons) they communicate with each other using electrical signals. Assisting this signaling but decreasing branching flexibility of grey matter, there exists an insulatory &amp;lsquo;myelin&amp;rsquo; sheath around axons formed by fatty, cholesterol-built cells (white matter).

      <description>When there is an infection or another source of inflammation in the body, special chemicals alert mature neutrophils, which then leave the bone marrow and travel through the bloodstream to the site in need. Neutrophil blood levels increase naturally in response to infections, injuries, and other types of stress. They may decrease in response to severe or chronic infections, drug treatments, and genetic conditions. +++(Note Diagnostic use)+++ 55–70 percent of all white blood cells in the bloodstream Made in bone marrow.</description>

      <description>We had beaten back the fierce thrust launched by our foes on our fort. We knew that we could fend off their assault as long as we held the fort. However, on realistically assessing the situation we realized that this hardly meant that we had won the war. We had been greatly weakened by the several years of constant war on the frontiers. For an empire to remain in good health a lot actually depends on the internal conditions.</description>

They often tend to be short messages leading to other links. Sometimes, they are followed by discussions.
Research news Besides internet journals and pre-print collections, twitter feeds and blogs of researchers tend to be a very good source of research news.
Lectures and course-notes are considered separately.
Curation of articles and comments News can be chosen, curated, arranged and presented either by a small group of professional editors (Eg: BBC, Time, etc.</description>

      <description>“Burg Niedeck ist im Elsass der Sage wohlbekannt. Die Höhe, wo vorzeiten die Burg der Riesen stand.”-Adelbert von Chamisso
I stood before the great vimalashambhu. The amR^ita flowed from the heaven cup of soma and drenched the great nityaklinnA on the 4th point of the yoni triangle. Raimented in the red, her limbs were smeared with red unguent, she held a skull bowl filled with red wine. Her face was full of smiles and restless with desire.</description>

      <description>Number of partitions, k See statistics ref for further info.
Minimum cut objectives Maybe find \(argmin_{(V_{i})} cut((V_{i}))\): but \(V_{1} = V\) minimizes it. So, to balance the partitions, associate each vertex with a weight w(v), get W = diag(w(v)); define \(w(V_{i}) = \sum_{v \in V_{i}} w(v)\); minimize \(Q((V_{i})) = \sum \frac{cut(V_{i})}{w(V_{i})}\).
Ratio, normalized cuts If \(w(v) = 1\), get ratio cut objective fn. So, ratio cut is trying to minimize the weight of cross-cut edges, averaged over the nodes.</description>

      <description>Searching for a goal node Problem; initial state; successor function; goal test; path cost; step cost.
The search tree vs state graph; its branching factor. NP hardness. Optimality vs completeness of algorithms. Eg: Route finding problem with a map; TSP.
Uninformed Search problem Breath first search; exponential memory demands. When pathcost varies: Uniform cost search.
Depth first search: linear space complexity. Iterative deepening DFS: use diameter of state graph. When pathcost varies: Iterative lengthening search.</description>

      <description>गोत्र-प्रवर-विचारः Summary  As late as the 11th c. AD, in the Gotra-Pravara-Manjari of Purusottama-Pandita, it is written as still prevalent that the gotra-pravara system applies to brahman (arsheya) lineages only: the Baudhayana-Pravara-Adhyaya mentions that the (biological) descendants of the seven rishis plus Agastya as the eighth are called gotra: this is the arsha-gotra (pita-putra parampara).
The conventional sense is used as laukika-gotra (guru-shishya parampara/which non-brahmans use). Over the centuries, during to social and cultural changes, various groups in India have adopted the gotra system, but the pravara system still applies only to brahman gotras.</description>

Norm: Defining properties A seminorm which obeys positive definiteness (\(\norm{x} = 0\) iff \(x\) = 0.). Often triangle inequality is the only non trivial property to verify. Prenorm omits trinagle inequality.
All norms are metrics (see topology ref).

      <description>Design factors Words and bits Suppose \(b\) bits are available to store a certain type of number: this is usally expressed in terms of multiples of words (collection of \(w\) bits). Because binary logic is used for addressing and processing, \(w\) is generally a power of 2. In old days, it used to be \(w = 2^2\), now 64 bit words are common.
Simplicity of computation logic Some representation formats require simpler and more efficient circuits for performing basic arithmetic operations than others.</description>

      <description>Object oriented design is considered in the software architecture survey.
Object manipulation The main idea of object oriented programming is to describe computation in terms of manipulating states of objects. This causes state changes to be local - which helps programmers design a well structured view of state and behavior.
This is distinct from the functional programming paradigm.
Encapsulation and locality Hiding data and methods from outside methods restricts state changes to be local.</description>

      <description>Best choice: organic cold pressed oils. For deep frying - go for sesame oil (traditional hindu choice) or coconut oil.
Production Cold pressed Cold pressed oils are obtained by physical pressing of the seeds, fruits &amp;amp; nuts and forcing the oil out. This is the same as the traditional process to extract oils.
Refined oils Refined oils are the oils that are extracted through the use of solvents and through bleaching and deodorizing processes.</description>

      <description>Rise From MT
 The alliance comprised four major Western Mongol tribes: Khoshut, Choros, Torghut and Dörbet. Smaller tribes belonging to the confederation included the Khoits, Zakhchin, Bayids and Mangits. &amp;ldquo;After 1370 CE the power of the Qubilaid Mongols declined precipitously leaving Mongolia in chaos, with several contenders jostling for supremacy but none gaining any ground. As they were fighting each other, the Kirghiz lord Ugechi routed the Qubilaid Khan Elbek and killed him in a battle in 1399 CE.</description>

      <description>The muni and me stood on the elevated wall of the plinth of the shanivAr palace (Shaniwar palace) on a blazing Indian afternoon about an year ago. That was all that was left of the palace built by the famed Peshwa, who had raised the Maharattas to their greatest glory. The Peshva was a Brahmin of the coastal community different from the interior brahmins of Maharashtra. Some have believed that these Brahmins had origins elsewhere in North India, but genetically they are not very different from other “pa~ncha-draviDa” brahmin groups.</description>

      <description>We were passing noting the immersion of the folks in the pAsha of moha. We were trying to take the upward passage when we encountered the terrific kR^ityA. The kR^ityA was blocking our path even as the kR^ityA of rudra that swallowed our ancient clansman ushanas. We evaded her narrowly and moved past despite sustaining a blow from it. The flow of internal surA from the brahmarandhra quieted us even as a morbid yajamAna who has been struck by the fury of soma is quieted by the external surA.</description>

Clear finish vs paint  Duration of protection: Paint generally lasts longer. Reapplication: Varnish/ natural oils are easier to reapply. Can do oneself - using dipped cloth. Old paint needs to be sanded away.  Wax polish  Mostly floor wax products can be used.</description>

      <description>Theme Ontology is concerned with entities: their classification and relationship. Every entity has certain properties.
Motivation The main benefit of ontology is that one can reason about an entity using general statements about the corresponding entity type.
Ontologies are very useful, for example, in the case of understanding speech - where many different words (eg: man, indian .. ) are used to hint at the same entity.
Entity-types Entities having several properties in common can be viewed as being instances of a single entity-type.</description>

      <description>Distinctive features of the language Purpose of design Inspired by functional programming languages.
Distributed computing: There&amp;rsquo;ll be many services on the internet, need a language to orchestrate them. So, good internet mashup language.
Good for concisely reasoning about distrubted systems.
Sites Everything is a site: a possibly remote function without side-effect which may not respond. Even +, -, if(..) etc.. are sites. These may return sites too. Actual site call is not executed until all arguments are available.</description>

      <description>Here we consider basic (possibly multi-step) actions involving various negotiable instruments in the market.
Buying and selling Basic actions in a stock market are to buy or sell a security. The securities exchange has programs/ machines which effectively communicate the price of various stocks based on what prices people are asking/ willing to pay for them - by recording these bids.
Market price order A market order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the current market price.</description>

      <description>Total order All \((x, y) \in S\) comparable.
Minimum element \(\forall y \in S: x\leq y\).
Partial order Aka Posets: Partially Ordered sets. Maybe some \((x, y) \in S\) not comparable. Eg: vectors, componentwise \(&amp;lt;\). Visualize with Hasse diagrams.
Minimal element \(\forall y \in S: x\leq y \implies x = y\). Note difference from minimum. Eg: in triangle joining (1,1), (0, 1), (1, 0): line joining the last 2 pts are minimal elements.</description>

      <description>Source of water  &amp;ldquo;Recently, enstatites have been in the news because a recent study has shown that they contain sufficient Hydrogen with a specific isotopic signature to have contributed to the emergence of a major fraction of the water on the Earth. This strengthens a big role for the enstatite bodies in the origin of the Earth and its water. &amp;hellip; The authors of the said recent study admit this fact and propose that carbonaceous chondrites of the Ivuna-type could have supplied additional water after the initial formation of the Earth to result in its current isotopic signature.</description>

We had earlier alluded to the seizure of our khANDava in what seemed a successful campaign. A little did we know that we were headed to worst of the existential crises we had ever faced as result of our possession of khANDava.</description>

Owners usually get a portion of profit as ’dividends’. They have a say in appointing the highest level/ board of executives/ managers who run the company on their behalf.

      <description>Chapter Scope A signle programming language can support multiple paradigms. Programming language features enabling different programming paradigms and architectures are considered elsewhere. Eg: Higher order functions underlies functional programming paradigm.
Imperative vs declarative programming Imperative programming Views computation in terms of altering state.
Structured programming In this programming paradigm, state changes are restricted locally. This helps organize code and state information. Structured programming code is more easily understood and maintainable than common procedural language code.</description>

From collaborations, even boring aspects of research become more pleasant. Enthusiasm for research increases. It is also more pleasurable. See benefits of pair programming in ’programming strategy’.

These included
-Tondo -Butuan -Cebu -Madyas
&amp;ldquo;The Rajahante of Cebu was interesting because it was found by Sri Lumay who claimed Chola descent. When the Cholas invaded Sriwijaya, a branch of Cholas settled there are married native Malay wives. One of the princes went to Philippines to establish his own kingdom.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Recent studies indicate that high intake of antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C, E and beta-carotene) does not appear to provide significant protection against Alzheimer’s disease. It is Phytochemicals in fruits or vegetables that provide the real benefit. The skins of fruits and vegetables are particularly rich in these phytochemicals. Recent studies have shown that polyphenols (like resveratrol in wine) extend maximum lifespan by 59 percent and delay age-dependent decay of cognitive performance in animal models.</description>

      <description>One must use the language most appropriate language to solve the problem at hand quickly and with computational efficiency.
Sometimes, a tradeoff may be involved: tradeoff between expressiveness and efficiency of a language. One may even use different programming languages to specify different parts of the logic to the computer.
Expressiveness/ conciseness Expressiveness is important in rapid prototyping/ programming. The presence of useful libraries is a major factor which affects conciseness.</description>

      <description>They were buffalo hunters. They were essentially a stone-age tribe.
War Their war strategy was mostly guerrilla warfare. Their battles were essentially well planned raids - initially for stealing horses, cattle and captives. In raids, all adult males were automatically killed. Young children were sometimes adapted. Women were enslaved.
Captives They also traded in captives. THey acquired horses from the Spanish territories. They raided to capture horses and captives from others.</description>

      <description>Specifying decision algorithm An agent may have several (sub)objectives it can act towards.
Eg: An navigation agent that wants to know the user&amp;rsquo;s destination may have to decide between asking for a nearby landmark, or for the street name or for a clarification of prior utterence.
Rule based vs utility computation So, the agent needs some way of prioritizing various sub-objectives/ actions. It may do this using some rigid rules.</description>

 Pick a simple asset allocation model, stick to it, rebalance occasionally.  Possibly put a small portion of money in high-risk high-reward places. (NN Taleb&amp;rsquo;s barbell strategy.)   Initially, be equity heavy. But put some money in bonds (negatively correlated with equity).  USA - TSM core 5/8, SV tilt 3/8.   Switch to fixed income heavy portfolio when retiring.  &amp;ldquo;Let us call the first set ensemble probability (concerned with a collection of people) and the second one time probability or ergodicity (concerned with one person through time).</description>

      <description>We paused for a moment looking out from our high perch into the foggy haze of the air around us. The joys of the world it appeared had deserted us. The devas had sent the brief respite, but it was all over. Why are we here we asked ourselves ?
Our mind raced back to the days of war between October-December of the year 2004. It was a fairly decisive period, but little did we know what the seizure of khANDAva had in store for us.</description>

DISCUSSION PAPER
Reader notes So much of this paper rang true even regarding my own experience as a grad student in USA 2007-10. Suhas mentions: &amp;ldquo;(This) has had a great influence on me, and several others (like Vishvas) that I have shared it with. Thank you for giving me the right perspective towards science at an early stage in my scientific training.</description>

      <description>There was more than one discussion recently as to whether the tantric goddess pratya~NgirA was associated with a kR^ityA prayoga. The atharvan text clearly deploys the sUkta of pratichIna A~Ngirasa as a counter charm against kR^ityAs. An extension of the deployment, similar in spirit is seen in the R^ig vidhAna of shaunaka. MS Bhat titled his study on the R^igvidhAna as “Vedic Tantrism”. This title is somewhat appropriate because the vidhAna appears to represent intermediate condition through which the evolution of vedic prayogas into tantric prayogas occured.</description>

      <description>Be wary of taste: Stomach over brain over tongue Taste was evolved to identify nutrient rich food; but in the modern world, the tongue is easily fooled by cleverly mixed chemicals. In this high calorie environment, it is not wise to trust whims of the tongue.
But, that said, the autonomous ganglion in stomach needs to be satisfied.
Vegetarianism In accordance with culture and current knowledge of healthy nutrition, stay ovo-lacto vegetarian.</description>

      <description>Overview It is very important to critique a paper or a talk, understand its shortcomings, suggest future improvements. Thence, incremental research occurs.
General loop: Find area. Find problem in a given area. Find solution strategy for a given problem. Implement solution, evaluate, communicate.
Popular research mode: Knowing and heavily using old techniques: take a few hammers, hit everything with it. Finding new techniques is rare and hard.
OFTEN, perturb the problem and extrapolate a solution.</description>

      <description>Components Every processor consists of an arithmetic and logic unit/ circuit (ALU), a few memory registers with a few layers of cache, memory and graphics controller circuits in order to be able to perform I/O operations and using extended working memory.
Tight knit Parallelism Multiple cores Usually multiple cores share memory.
Pipelines Aka instruction level parallelism.
Processing often has pipeline structure; eg: fetch instruction, fetch data, execute instruction, store data. There are usually separate functional units within a single processor which take care of these separate tasks in each clock cycle.</description>

      <description>Workshops: Some explicitly deny that a presentation in a workshop does not count as a publication. So such stuff is publishable elsewhere. Other workshops are contrary.
Publish long versions of conference papers in journals.
1 top tier paper = many 2nd tier papers. It is far more important to publish regularly in a top tier conference than to publish profusely in a 2nd tier conference. Read papers from those conference and aim for such work.</description>

The studious youth busied themselves with the most mundane of chemical experiments. Some were vigorously blowing into a charcoal lump with the hope of seeing a bead of lead. Yet others were soulfully bubbling a foul smelling miasma of sulfuretted hydrogen through a tube and waiting for a precipitate to form with bated breath.</description>

Never aim to say ’I am full’ after eating; instead aim to say: ’I won’t be hungry for 4 hours.’. Do not eat to relieve boredom or to take a break. Let it not be the dominant source of Ananda - use buddhi instead to gain Ananda from dhArmika-kAryas!
Example: Okinawans stop eating before they are 80% full: they say this to themselves before eating.</description>

      <description>Today I was at the Philadelphia museum- a few childhood dreams of mine were finally fulfilled. I got an opportunity to examine the following skulls and skeletons at some length:
1) The skull Eoraptor
2) The skull of Hererrasaurus
both of which are amongst the earliest theropods.
The skeletons of
3) Dromeosaurus and
4) Saurornithoides,
two deinonychosaurs close to the origins of birds
5) The second skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex (this specimen has a better preserved fore limb that allowed me study carpal and ungual morphology)</description>

      <description>The Rathvas are a peculiar tribe in Gujarat whose art was studied by Jyotirindra Jain. Most tribes of India preserve certain aboriginal traits that have are often interlaced with Indo-Aryan tendencies. Most commonly the rudra cult of the the Indo-Aryans and its various ramifications has been used as a conduit for the assimilation of aboriginal tribes. Hence, the most frequent Indo-Aryan elements are associated with the worship of rudra and his entourage, and syncretization of local goddess into the pan-Indo-Aryan transfunctional goddess cult.</description>

      <description>Embracing AIT  In 1898 Tilak wrote &amp;ldquo;The Arctic Home in the Vedas&amp;rdquo;. This work propounded the theory that the North Pole was the original home of the Aryans in the pre-glacial period, who migrated to the Northern parts of Europe, Asia and eventually India by about 3000 BCE. Savarkar wrote a booklet named &amp;ldquo;Essentials Of Hindutva&amp;rdquo; in 1923 - a foundational document in the history of the movement. In that pamphlet, he implicitly accepts the Aryan Invasion theory by talking of Aryans as a distinct race.</description>

      <description>Common assumptions A channel eventually (maybe at \(t=\infty\)) delivers all packets without corruption or dropping, in the correct order.
Processes can run at arbitrary, non 0 speed.
Don&amp;rsquo;t care about efficiency, focus on safety and progress.
Assume you have infinite buffers.
Synchronized communication Sometimes, this is needed. Max time to deliver a message is some t.
Proving algorithm efficacy Axiomatize the system, and use pure logic.
Usually 2 stages: safety property: you won&amp;rsquo;t fall into a wrong state; and progress property.</description>

Correctness Assertion Assertion p: Assume that p is true.
In practice, good programmers use special statements to check if assertions are true; eg: Java.
Correctness S is correct wrt precondition p and postcondition q if: starting with p true, run S, get q.
Partial correctness \(\set{p}S\set{q}\). S is correct wrt p and q if: starting with p true, if ye run S, ye get q if S terminates.</description>

      <description>General problem Many (x, y) pairs (observations), h(x, w) form (eg: degree of polynomial) known, parameters \(w\) in h(x, w) is unknown. Want to find \(w\). range(h) is not finite, it is usually continuous.
y is the response variable, \(w\) is called the regression vector. The matrix formed by \(x\) is often called the design matrix.
Many such continuous valued models are described in probabilistic models reference.
Linear regression The problem h(x, w) is linear in \(w\) (Eg: \(w_1 x^{3}+ w_2 \)x\( + w_3=0\): \(\ftr_{i}(x) = x^{i}\)).</description>

      <description>Natural state &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;We as human-beings are inherently social creatures, and are used to operating within cooperative circles of extended family, groups/gangs, villages/tribes, etc.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Outside of family, research suggests there are only three levels of relationships: 1) Daily contact with 1-2 people (your significant other and maybe a best friend), 2) Weekly contact with 3-5 people (true friends that provide instrumental support), 3) Everyone else.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;So what about the rest of your social network?</description>

      <description>Traditionalist Catholicism Status under Christianity “Traditionalist Catholicism” refers to a broad set of religious beliefs, traditions, and practices that generally align with Roman Catholicism, but intermingle Indigenous polytheism and practices to form a local syncretic faith.
Traditionalists are part of a loosely organized North American denominational movement often called Old Catholicism. This movement adopts and affirms Roman Catholic traditions and theology while asserting independence from Rome. While they are often conservative, Old Catholic denominations can differ widely among themselves and with Rome on issues such as the ordination of women, divorce, and homosexuality.</description>

      <description>Recent trajectory The communist party tried to eradicate religion starting from the cultural revolution - they tortured monks, destroyed monasteries. But this ceased in 1982. After economic growth in the 1990’s, recognizing a popular feeling of spiritual emptiness, the party promoted religion as an important part of developing a harmonious society, provided they support the party. Those that disagree are suppressed: Eg: Falun Gong, Catholic Church, some Tibetian Buddhism.</description>

      <description>Our sachIva had proposed a long and intricate escape plan that had promising aspects to it. It needed a particular maneuver that was difficult but could be achieved with the help of my greatest ally. I had started considering it seriously as an option in the event we face a defeat on the front #3. However, I suddenly realized that this escape route could very well turn out the route for exit from this earth.</description>

      <description>Here, rather than considering reproduction of cells in the body of a multicellular animal, we are concerned with production of entire new generations of organisms.
Sexual vs asexual Reproduction can be sexual or asexual. Some organisms are capable of both - they are aka hermaphrodites.
Sexual reproduction Combination of genes Sexual reproduction involves combination of genetic material from multiple (usually 2) organisms to produce genetic material for the next generation. Usually these parent organisms are of the same species.</description>

      <description>Risk and return-advantage types Risk in the investment is the potential to loose money. Risk is paired with advantage: investors promised a bigger return will tolerate some risk.
Credit default risk This risk is particularly relevant for bonds. This is the risk of businesses not repaying their loans.
The advantage is that riskier bonds yield bigger returns.
Credit rating agencies Sometimes, the ultimate owners of bonds sometimes do not have a clear idea about the risk involved.</description>

      <description>It may be essential to model \(Pr(L|X, S)\); this is called Inference in the context of probabilistic graphical models.
Loss functions: labeling single data points Different measures of goodness/ error functions are appropriate for different scenarios.
Loss functions: vector labels Loss functions in this case are often defined to penalize deviation from the actual label symmetrically.
See loss functions in regression section.
Loss functions for classification Below we mainly consider the loss functions \(l(\hat{y}, y)\) which are without regularization to account for prior belief.</description>

R then moved on to a Marpissa mucosa, while I drifted away towards a gorgeous Icius. At the that point for some reason we paused.</description>

      <description>Cause of rise Why did Rome expand from a small city state to an empire which spanned 3 continents?
Military ambition inculcation In the Roman republic, every notable person seeking greater power and reputation had to gain military victories. This meant that positive ambition was never in short supply. Political advancement (highly competitive) being heavily tied to military triumphs; led to stronger will to repeatedly keep up the wars.
Highly involved elites  Unlike the selfish elites of the later periods, the aristocracy of the Republic did not spare its blood or treasure in the service of the com interest.</description>

The rudra family: The wooden kumAra on the left is our patron deity, the deity of the clan and the protector deity. The idol is routinely installed on the trienniel skanda yAga performed as per the atharvaNa krama ordained by gopatha. The central idol is the bronze idol of uma and rudra that has been worshiped for a long time now by my clansmen for various festivals and receives regular rudrArchana.</description>

      <description>When Sambhaji seized power he invited his father’s advisor the bhakti saint Ramadas to meet him. However, Ramadas displeased by Sambhaji’s brutalities that accompanied his accession refused to meet him. His disciples however begged on him to advice the prince. Accordingly he sent him the following letter:
“Always be on guard and never lower you guard. Control your temper and be good and kind towards others. Forgive your subjects for their faults and bind them to your person by making them happy.</description>

The night before we had performed the adhara-kulAnanda rahas-tarpaNa of the beautiful but terrifying yakShiNi nIlalohita-mekhalA. We fatefully ventured out to the AvarNa-patha and were making our way for the midday oblations to savitA, when without warning we were struck by the terrifying devastambhini.</description>

      <description>To facilitate and encourage saving for large expenses in the future, governments often provide tax breaks for special investment accounts for retirement, medical expenses and children’s education (college funds).
See here.
Taxation-deferred funds Incomes earned using these special accounts are exempt from taxes while they stay within the fund. However, withdrawals, which are only under very restricted circumstances, are taxed.
Eg: Individual Retirement Account [IRA] in USA.
Profit-tax free funds Money may be taxed at the time it is deposited in the fund, while withdrawals are tax-free.</description>

      <description>Intro  per unit cost of a product drops with rising scale of production. Concentration of activity in industry and agriculture (even coffee shops!) is justified by economic theory on the grounds of economies of scale (aka &amp;ldquo;marginal cost of production&amp;rdquo;).  Limitations  Via S Vembu. The costs drop rapidly with scale at first but beyond a certain scale (let&amp;rsquo;s call it &amp;ldquo;optimal scale&amp;rdquo;), stop dropping or even start increasing as dis-economies of scale kick in.</description>

      <description>Central pattern  Since the beginning, Japan has constantly been a student-culture, rather than (mostly) inward looking smug know-it-all-culture like medieval India and China (in the post Tang era). Yet, they revered their own nation as the land of the kAmi, and were not swayed by anything and everything.  The Chinese, for example, considered whatever happened outside China much less important. This led to the defeats of the Qing empire [T1] at Japanese hands.</description>

Over Associative arrays When the elements are stored as an associative array - eg: hash-fn map or a treep, answering membership queries is O(1).
Fingerprinting Coding theory is useful here: see fingerprinting in information theory ref.
Sequential search and sorting Sequential search: O(n) in the worst case. When the list is unsorted, there is no choice but to do this.</description>

      <description>Basic operations include listing elements, checking set-membership, finding unions and intersections.
Set implementations include the ListSet and the BitSet.
Bit-set BitSet uses a sequence of bits - one for each element. Theoretically, it can store arbitrary elements which may be mapped to integers, but is often used to store integers. Its size is equal to the largest number N stored in the set, though it may store k elements; so, from this perspective, using it in preference to ListSet makes sense when the set is dense.</description>

      <description>Reference: McLean thesis here.  Difference in early collaboration  &amp;ldquo;There are clear discrepancies between the Buddhists and the Hindus of Sind both in their immediate response to the Arab invasion .and in the long term effect which the occupation had on them. That is, Buddhists tended to collaborate to a significantly greater extent and at an earlier date than did Hindus and, more&amp;rsquo; importantly, Buddhism disappeared completely as a viable religious system during the Arab period while Hinduism has continued to survive, in varying conditions of prosperity, until the present day.</description>

      <description>Measurable space Suppose that \(S\) is a \(\sigma\) algebra over \(X\). \((X, S)\) is called a measurable space. Every member of \(S\) is a measurable set.
\((S, 2^{S})\) is a common measurable space.
Importance This notion is useful because it enumerates the sets whose size we want to measure.
Product space You can take two measurable spaces \((S_1, F_1), (S_2, F_2)\), and, by set product get a bigger measurable space \((S_1 \times S2, F_1 \times F_2)\).</description>

      <description>Some aspects of memory consolidation only happen with more than six hours of sleep. [Ref]
Teenagers who stay up late on school nights and make up for it by sleeping late on weekends are more likely to perform poorly in the classroom. This is because, on weekends, they are waking up at a time that is later than their internal body clock expects. [Ref] Sleep debt can be repaid, though it won&amp;rsquo;t happen in one extended snooze marathon.</description>

      <description>Eco-friendliness  Choices: Rubber, jute, leather, rarely wood. But, many rubber/ jute slippers come with plastic straps and soles - not biodegradable. Best choice considering what&amp;rsquo;s available commonly and cheaply: Slippers with rubber soles (oft with polyurathene covering) and jute straps. Seems that polyurathene is sort-of biodegradable (40 yrs).  Comparison with shoes Adherance Slippers in general, adhere more lightly to the bottom of the feet than shoes do. Among slippers too, there are different levels of adherence.</description>

      <description>Empirical risk minimization vs expert systems One way to predict \(L\) given \(X\) is to learn the process by which \(L\) is generated: one can manually create a labeling algorithm by listing out rules which influence labeling: for example by studying expert human animals.
Often, you cannot know enough about how stuff works in order to have explicit rules. Eg: Expert system for handwriting detection can be tougher to make than a training a statistical model.</description>

We felt as though the Atman had ceased to be bound and made its universal identification.

      <description>I have always believed, since I was probably 11 years old, that it was important to study Neoplatonic thought and ritual. This is particularly important because it was one of the sister systems of our own, and was the only world philosophy with a reasonably comparable depth and scope. Importantly, as we are the only surviving heathens in the world with an unbroken link to our ancient traditions firstly of the shruti and then of the Agama-s, we alone, are in the unique position to study Neoplatonism from an insider’s perspective, which is entirely lacking for the western students of Graeco-Roman thought.</description>

      <description>In my childhood I was quite disappointed with our history books not providing any details what so ever, beyond even the merest mention, about the life and role of Sambhaji the brother of the founder of the Maharatta nation. So for long I wished to write a brief history Sambhaji, the brother of Shivaji, his contributions to the Hindu struggle and his early death on the battlefield. What ever we know of his struggle is mainly from Sanskrit chronicles like those of Paramanand and Jayaram Pandit (Maharatta Brahmin historians and contemporaries), supplemented by bakars and Farmans of the Mohammedans.</description>

      <description>Mustafa Khan’s invasions
Shah Jahan called on Adil Shah and Qutb Shah to destroy the Hindus of the South and bring the whole of Hind under Islam. First, Mustafa Khan attacked the Vijayanagaran army lead by the Nayaka Shivappa who had liberated Ikkeri (1645). The Hindus fought with great fury and inflicted severe losses on the Moslems in the battle of Sagar. But Mustafa Khan who greatly hated the Hindus was strengthened by reserves and he fell back on Shivappa Nayaka, routing him in the second battle of Ikkeri.</description>

      <description>Sambhaji and Shivaji break free
Following Shahji’s arrest his sons Sambhaji in Banglore and Shivaji in Pune started asserting their independence against the Moslems. With the help of the Brahmin advisers they started acting as independent *Hindu* rulers and did not remit any tributes to the Adil Shah. The Sultan acted quickly and sent a force under Asad Khan from Jinji to take Bangalore from Sambhaji. Sambhaji gave a notable display of his valor by routing the Moslem force advancing towards Banglore by after intercepting it on the way to the city.</description>

      <description>There is much reason to believe that the kAshyapa tradition is a real coherent tradition of magico-medical practices in post-Vedic India that survived in some form or the other in the midst of other traditions until recently. At some point, after we discovered the coherence of this tradition, we had thought of a 3-way collaboration with shAradA and R to produce a more scholarly piece on the various aspects of this tradition — both in terms of the printed texts and what ever little information we could gather about unpublished manuscripts of this tradition.</description>

She drew much better later in life, but I was never able to get her to draw more like these again. It is sad that a great tapestry of the yogini-s, vArAhI, mantriNI, ashvAruDhA and kAmeshvarI, in their war march, that she drew with considerable detail seems to be lost now.</description>

      <description>Why heroes? Stories of heros are often riveting; remembering their stories is an important part of cultivating a self which strives for these qualities when appropriate.
Why heroes from bhArata? We are emotionally (and biologically) attached to this 5000+ year old culture and people; so the inspiration we can draw from them is much stronger.
Why make a list? Maybe this interests others. Helps organize one&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on the matter, frees up my overly engrossed mind to pursue other interests.</description>

      <description>Tamil lands Overview You broadly have two waves of large scale brahmin migration to the South
 a. The Purvaśikhā brahmins who presently form a small section of Chozhiar brahmins in Tamil Nadu + Kerala Namboothiris (these migrations pre-date Sangam age). Purvashika means tuft pointing to the front. b. Aparaśikhā brahmins who constitute the vast bulk of brahmins in Tamil country today&amp;hellip;who settled for the most part during the mature Pallava / Chola period (5th to 10th century).</description>

      <description>Problem Generating process Suppose that the \(p\) dimensional &amp;lsquo;observation vector&amp;rsquo; \(Y\) is generated from \(Y_i \distr N(\gth_i, \stddev^2) = \gth_i + N(0, \stddev^2)\). \(\stddev\) is known.
In addition suppose that \(\gth\) is sparse. The set \(K = \set{i: \gth_i \neq 0}\) is called the signal set.
\(n\) observations \(\set{Y_i = y_i}\) are made. Usually \(n &amp;laquo; p\).
Decision rule sought The problem for the decision rule, given \(Y_i\) (the observation), is to estimate \(\gth_i\).</description>

      <description>Pocket computers Components These devices are very compact, and often combined with specialized equipment like ability to connect to certain mobile phone networks, GPS, gyroscopes, compasses, cameras, flash led&amp;rsquo;s, accelerometers. Such components often make single function devices much less attractive.
Customizability The hardware customizability is often very limited; but communication interfaces (eg: bluetooth, card slots) enable expansion.
OS The operating systems used are often not easily switched; but may be upgradeable or hacked in minor ways.</description>

      <description>Buttons Buttons are often provided, dedicated for a simgle (possibly broad) purpose. These include buttons to power off, adjust volume, reset the computer etc.. They provide a useful, cheap ever-present way of accepting input from the user, which is partly why they are not located on the screen.
Dials Dials - simulated or otherwise - are very useful for accepting numeric input; and are therefore provided in case of clocks, timers, etc.</description>

      <description>Problem The problem is for the user to communicate a task to a machine through a verbal dialog. A dialog consists of several &amp;lsquo;turns&amp;rsquo;, with the user and the machine speaking alternately within each turn.
Since the machine&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo; (aka dialog state) about the user&amp;rsquo;s task changes as the dialog proceeds, this problem is also called belief-tracking.
Examples Voice mail system. Bus route information system. Route system.

      <description>A standard language for dealing with RDBMS. So, data can be visualized as being stored in tables.
Help and tutorials w3schools has a good tutorial.
Values Strings are enclosed as here: &amp;lsquo;asdf&amp;rsquo;.
Query language Query table The query table may be specified in several ways. In the most basic case, it is a single table.
 table1 (as t1), table2 represents a cross-product, aka cross join. This returns a table whose rows are members of tbl1 X tbl2.</description>

      <description>Aka formula.
Language Syntax All sentences are written with symbols/ words drawn from some alphabet, in a formal language. A statement/ formula is said to be well formed if it makes sense according to some formal grammar.
Values The most basic statements are the values T / TRUE and F/ FALSE.
Semantics Corresponding to languages of various levels of expressiveness, there are Logics/ calculii which specify the semantics. They, for example, specify what &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo;, \(\lnot P\) etc.</description>

      <description>Kurus  There were people with uniquely Indian admixture operating even in Central Asia around the time of the Aryan transition. This suggests that Indo-Aryan power was actually straddling their steppe base &amp;amp; northern India. I believe the memory of the former is that of the uttara-kuru-s. &amp;hellip; [I] hold that a branch of these steppe kuru-s re-emerged with another allied clan the kamboja much later on the Iranians side to form the elite of the hAkamAnashIya dynasty.</description>

Plastics  According to The Green Guide, a website and magazine devoted to greener living and owned by the National Geographic Society, the safest plastics for repeated use in storing food are made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE, or plastic #2), low-density polyethylene (LDPE, or plastic #4) and polypropylene (PP, or plastic #5). [Ref] Some of its food storage containers use polycarbonate (plastic #7), which has been shown to leach the harmful hormone-disrupting chemical Bisphenol A (BPA) into food items after repeated uses.</description>

      <description>Magnetic storage Unlike optical storage, magnetic storage is re-writable.
Bus interface While SCSI has a processor integrated into the controller, SATA makes greater use of the system processor to serve that function; the former is costlier.
Quality Hard disk drives differ mainly in speed, storage capacity, size, redundancy (RAID), error correction, shock resistance.
Best and economical Areal density doubling every two to four years since their invention. So, even 1TB is economical.</description>

Low level operations Important special cases defined based on restrictions on insertion and deletion operations include stacks, queues, priority queues. In the case of stacks, elements leave the sequence in a last in first out (LIFO) order. In case of queues, elements leave in a first in first out (FIFO) order.
Higher level operations These operations are defined in terms of low level operations described earlier: Eg: map, filter etc.</description>

      <description>One must avoid rapid rises and fall in sugar levels in most circumstances - except after exercise, when it is used up by muscles. Reasons: According to link: suppression of immune system and growth hormone secretion, promotion of inflammation, glycation, and insulin-resistence (by promoting fat livers even in lean people according to link ).
Further complications include: higher blood pressure, higher trglyceride levels, lower HDL cholesterol levels, higher LDL cholesterol levels (aka metabolic syndrome), thence leading to both type 2 diabetes and heart disease (surprise!</description>

Given \(N\) examples \(\set{x_{i}}\); project to some feature space associated with kernel \(k(x,y) = \ftr(x)^{T}\ftr(y)\); want to find hyperplane \(w^{T}\ftr(x) - \gr\) such that all points in the support fall on one side of the hyperplane, outliers fall on the other side: support identifier \(f = sgn(w^{T}x - \gr)\); so, allowing a soft margin, want to solve \(\max_{\gr, w} \frac{\gr}{\norm{w}} + C\sum \gx_{i}\) such that \(w^{T}\ftr(x_{i}) + \gx_{i} \geq \gr, \gx_{i} \geq 0\); \(\equiv\) obj function: \(\min_{w, \gx, \gr} \norm{w}^{2}/2 + \frac{1}{\gn N} \sum \gx_{i} - \gr\), for some coefficient \(0 \leq \gn \leq 1\).</description>

      <description>The below heavily draws from @porbotialora&amp;rsquo;s account.
Xianbei campaigns  The 1st one was in 446 and was driven by Daoists. Daoism was made into the state religion and Buddhism was outlawed and Buddhist monks and clerics were massacred by the army and Buddhist temples, idols and books were destroyed. This was by a Xianbei emperor who was converted to Daoism by Kou Qianzhi, a Han who was Heavenly master of the northern Heavenly Master sect of Daoism (unlike the southern based one of the Zhang family).</description>

      <description>Downsides  Invasive surgery can cause more harm than good - and should be elected with care.  Examples  An artificial knee may get infected, leading to pus discharge, swelling and pain. Immune system cells have a harder time getting there and cleaning up. Myopes considering refractive surgery are advised that surgically correcting their nearsightedness may actually be a disadvantage after the age of 40 when the eyes become presbyopic and lose their ability to accommodate or change focus because they will then need to use glasses for reading.</description>

      <description>Intro  Switches are put on top of switch boxes (often embedded within walls) covered by a panel and perhaps a frame. Switch box sizes are: 2M/ model/ module (accommodates 2 switches), 6M, 8M, 12M, 18M.  Wifi switch  Connects to Google Home or Alexa. Good for scheduled powering. Tinxy installation video here. Loads less than 1kW ok. Wiring: AC input is provided to the switch. Then, phase wires are sent from the switch to the loads (which will have neutral wiring separately).</description>

      <description>Early history  They were of Tibetan ethnicity, with significant Altaic input.  &amp;ldquo;From the Chinese evidence we observe that their predecessors or at least that of the ruling Ngvemi clan of the Tanguts might have originally had links to the Tabgach (Chinese: Tuoba) people with Altaic affinities: they were either early Turks or Mongols or a distinct extinct branch of the Altaic family. &amp;quot; &amp;ldquo;In their earliest days going back to the 300-400 CE they appear to have had marriage relationships with the para-Mongolic Tuyuhun (Tuguhun) Khaganate and played a role in the formation of this state in between the Tibetans and the Chinese.</description>

Defrosting Never defrost foods in a garage, basement, car, dishwasher or plastic garbage bag; out on the kitchen counter, outdoors or on the porch. There are three safe ways to defrost food: in the refrigerator, in cold water, or in the microwave. [Ref] Refreezing:
It is safe to refreeze, provided you did not introduce or allow the multiplication of bacteria during thawing.</description>

He declared that their defeat was due to them having no horse-standard and recommended that they invoke the Suelde Tengri the god of the horse-banner. Then appeared 9 divine brothers armed with swords, tiger-skin quivers and bows, the eldest of whom was Suelde Tengri, riding fiery horses (corresponding to the nine horse tails of the banner).</description>

      <description>Signs of understanding Ability to reduce everything to elementary school mathematics signifies true understanding.
Ability to solve textbook problems is another important sign.
Reconstruction ability One must be able to reconstruct important knowledge acquired so far, relevant to the subject being studied, from scratch. This must be done with minimal external reference, and with the power of one’s memory and abilities. This is helpful in preparing the mind for studies and in solidifying knowledge.</description>

      <description>We completed the fortifications on various crags and they stood reasonably. Shortly after we had done so the hostile forces opened a massive assault on front #3. Our fortifications fended the attack, but were severely tested. We then strengthened some further outposts, and called off all diplomats. Then, tired as never before, we retired to rest. After that we went to inspect one of the fortifications, when a massive hostile thrust occurred on front #1.</description>

At the head waters of the Onon River, at the foot of the sacred mountain of Burkhan Khaldun, in northern Mongolia a great throng of humanity was assembling. Jamuqa, the once aristocratic leader of the Jadaran tribe had been executed and there was one master of all Mongolia- Temujin. Thousands of horses, sheep and cattle were herded in and enormous lines of felt gers (tents) stretched in long lines leading to the grand central tent.</description>

      <description>One of the tragic battles that represents the epitome of the valiant struggle of Hindu rulers against the numerically superior Moslem armies buttressed by the quintessential Hindu traitors was the battle of Haldighat. It stands for that great freedom struggle closer to the imperial capital of the country (relative to those in the south) occupied by the Moslem tyrants since Ghori’s invasions. Many years ago, when I was still a kid I received from my father a gift of a stone from Rajastan coming from the Haldighat geological horizon.</description>

      <description>Saved from here.
From the accounts of vedic tradition the bhRgu-s were the foremost of the RShi-s. It appears that they were the founders of the fire ritual which is at the heart of the vedic religion. They are not authors of many mantra-s of the Rg veda, though their surrogate clan, the shaunahotra-s, have a maNDala to themselves (RV2). Nevertheless, bhRgu or the bhRgu-s are mentioned 27 times by name in the RV.</description>

      <description>I was standing alone in the railway station in the bleak winter air. There was not a single sound and the air hung eerily as though weighed down by the cold. Suddenly the air quivered with the fluttering of a pigeon’s wings as it made its roostward retreat and then there was silence again- the shakuna! The sun sunk on the pashchima mayukha, leaving behind the gloaming and the azure depths of dyaus turned inky dark.</description>

      <description>The news reached us that rakShohA agni had cleared 3 of the vR^itra and nirR^iti had gone back her way. We thought the clouds were clearing. But Fourier’s man, who was feared as shUravarman, got the news too. Never had he been intimidated thus or his men faced such uchChATana-s. He accordingly released the deadly “crane arrow”. Never was balance between life and death so clear.
Past mid-night we faced the terror of the crane.</description>

      <description>We bow to the great goddess of the trotalottaraM and pay worship to the great throng of yakShiNI-s that emerge from her. The yakShiNI-s are of diverse forms, all very wonderful and amazing. They bear many diverse facets of knowledge — he who can acquire them all becomes sarva-vyApin. But the knowledge is not easily acquired from the yakShiNI. There are so many ways in which they slip away after it has been shown to you by her.</description>

      <description>Nagor had been occupied by the Mohammedans after Khalji’s dreaded acts and it passed into the hands of the Khans of Gujarat related to the Turkic Qara U’nas tribe [To which the great Amirs of the Southern alliance like Qazaghan and Mir Hussain belonged]. The Khan of Nagor was the fierce Firoz Khan, a terror of Hindus, who died in 1454. On the death of Firoz, his son Shams Khan ascended the gaddi.</description>

      <description>The best remembered of our expeditions were those to the city of bhairava, the fort of tridents and the long-winded peregrinations through the Maharatta countryside.In the halcyon days Mis-creant, muscleman S, his shUdra sycophant (shUdra shreShTha=SS) and me were seated on our parked vehicles and yarning in the vicinity of a little shrine of a medieaval devotional vaiShNava cult descending from the mahAnabhav cult. There were some devotional singers doling out the tune of a medieaval saint of the Maharatta country, whose song roughly translated thus: “Our pANDuraNGa is not like the goddess jAkhAI, jokhAI, mAyArANI or mhaisAbAI.</description>

      <description>A friend, in course of a yarning session, reminded me of the days of bhoga. In a social situation with Marc, R and Hayastanika we were all ganging to make fun of R. A person, who shall go un-named, remarked in full auditory range of Marc that, if R is around, people stop paying attention everyone else but her. This statement by that person could have caused me enormous social damage in an as-it-is tense situation.</description>

      <description>By 1687 the Mogol tyrant from Dilli, had fulfilled the dream cherished by his ancestors since the days of the tyrant Akbar, namely to conquest of the Deccan Sultanates. In a whirl wind campaign Awrangzeeb had conquered the Adil Shahi kingdom, founded by the prince Adil Khan the brother of the Ottoman sultan Mehmet II Fathi of Turkey and the Qutb Shahi kingdom which was bravely defended to the very end by the Turk, Abdur Razzak.</description>

      <description>Our ancestress reNukA, the ikShvAku princess and wife of jamadagni, is supposed to have had a checkered career. She is supposed to have been adultrous having had an affair with a yadu prince of mArtikavata, which led to our illustrious ancestor jamadagni’s wrath and the famous story concerning rAma that needs no repetition now.
jamadagni was accused by some modern interlocutors as being unjust to her (but I realized their knowledge did not go beyond the tale narrated in the Amar Chitra Katha comics, where jamadagni merely say she had ‘sinned’ without any reference to what the sin was.</description>

The last days of this glorious pITha under the constant assault of the Mohammedans poorly known, but we can piece together some details from the Chinese chronicles and the rAjatara~NgiNi of kalhaNa. The heroic Hindu resistance in this region is largely forgotten but we provide an outline, which we hope to fill in the future.</description>

      <description>Never before had I descended to such a low, especially given all the show I had made. It was like Tendulkar scoring two zeroes in a row. All around us were atirathis and mahArathis (mark that word for it is indeed a pun) but still I was a mahArathi too, who had taken on the intense heat of battle. Pricked quick by the defeats I had faced, but confident about my abilities, I made a charge, even as Prataprao had done in the fateful battle of Ahmednagar, and blew away our rival mahArathis in a battle that knew no bounds in its fury.</description>

      <description>We circumambulated the large lake at the base of Mount Kearsarge with mlechCha adventurer M. We were separated from the bandhas of samsAra at that point. We saw the old va~nga chieftain at the end of it. The va~nga had battled our old foe for a long time and outwitted him much as we had. He enquired about R1, R2, R3, K1, K2 and S. These brought very painful memories to our mind.</description>

      <description>With the due assent I decided to narrate the account of R1‘s father&amp;rsquo;s encounter with the vile pAShaNDa-s of the nAstIka mata- this is an illustrative example of some technicalities for the complete uchChATana of paShaNDa mantras. The other learned vR^iddhA had also demolished the prayoga-s of such a pAShaNDa from the vanga country. The old R1F had journeyed deep into the were the practitioners of the fallen ways of mahAchInAchAra and upachInAchAra still wandered.</description>

      <description>After the death of Hambirrao Mohite, the Mogol armies pressed hard on the Maharattas forcing them to the strongest fortresses in Sahayadris for shelter. Awrangzeeb’s army was struck by bubonic plague, but he continued moving his vast divisions westwards to encircle the Maharattas. He also sent a division towards Bangalore and Tamil Nad to cut out the southern base of the Marathas. Sambhaji, without his ace general was entirely in the control of his base Kanyakubja Brahmin minister Kalash.</description>

      <description>These thoughts sprung in course of one of those extended conversations that we had. As we passed by train to the city of our birth we saw the typical landscape of the southern Deccan plains: The clusters of castellated granite hills and rock spurs of granite. These granite landscapes immensely fascinated us, and in our early days we spent a great deal of effort investigating their geology. We then had our encounter with their archaeology which we never fathomed till we ran into Allchin’s work.</description>

One of the shUdra-s asked, O foreign brahmin, should we participate in a vigorous game of kandUka kR^iDa in the yonder kandukaprastha that lies beyond the nAga-bila and at the foot hills of the vAnara parvata. The other shUdra said: this place is blessed with many women who are the handiworks of manmatha, yet why is it we are cursed to wander in these uninteresting assemblages with nothing more of interest than the aforesaid kR^IDa.</description>

Our track record was mixed. The first encounter was a dismal disaster despite the good weather conditions.</description>

      <description>I received a call from him. He sounded much the same rustic fellow as I hand last enountered him over 8 years ago. His accent was the same rasping one, which sounded like a metal plate rubbing on another. I asked what had befallen him. He replied that he had been to the house beside the curve on the northward street and was quite sick after his stay there. I was shocked, that this could happen.</description>

      <description>I received a call from him. He sounded much the same rustic fellow as I hand last enountered him over 8 years ago. His accent was the same rasping one, which sounded like a metal plate rubbing on another. I asked what had befallen him. He replied that he had been to the house beside the curve on the northward street and was quite sick after his stay there. I was shocked, that this could happen.</description>

      <description>“svargeNa svargaM”
There were two cell phones. One of mine and one of Jx. They were both mundane objects. There were numerous cell phones like that in the market. The one Jx possessed was very sleekly designed and was easy to use. The one I possessed was one which Jx coveted but I found very difficult to use. The Mumbai hecklers asked us: After all your mantra and tantra did your arcane gods only give you this cell phone?</description>

      <description>While we were still being relentless hammered by the shiva-yuvatI of mahArudra, we decided to attend to the long-standing battle where the young yoddha was faltering. It was the glorious quest of what was code-named: “ghR^itagaNa cha dvyAmlaka”, a high prize that I had earned for since my earliest days in the senAmukha, in the halcyon teens, filled with youthful intemperance. Now as a veteran of many bloody wars in which the devas had seen us through, I was still being rebuffed on that front.</description>

      <description>The redoubtable bhAskararAya was one of the greatest shrauta sacrificers and exponents of the tantra of recent times. He would rank no less than great savants of the mantra shAstra throughout bhArata, through the ages, like amoghavajra and indrabodhi of Kanchipuram, vasugupta, lakshmaNa deshikendra and abhinavagupta of Kashmir, sha~nkara bhagavatpAda of the Chera country, dIpAMkarashriGYAna of Kalinga, mahIdhara dIkShita of Kashi and matsyendra of the icy Himalayas. He was born in Hyderabad in ~1690 as the second son of gambhIraraya and koNamAmbAL of the kaushika gotra [several southerners claim that he belonged to the vaDamA branch of smArtas, while Maharashtrians claim that he was of the Deshasta branch of Maharatti Brahmins.</description>

      <description>Berossus, the priest of Marduk of the great god of the Babylonians declared in the 3rd century BC that 432000 solar years was the time that had elapsed from the origin of divine kingship to the end of the world. He believed that when 432000 years elapsed from the begining of divine kingship, the planets would conjunct in Capricorn and mark the begining of a world destroying fire. Many western scholars have assumed that this number entered India and was taken up by the paurANic bards for describing the mahAyuga.</description>

      <description>Are standing in front of the guillotine?
Or did you walk through the guillotine before the blade fell?
Or is your head on the block waiting the fall of the blade?
One verily does not know..
Sometimes you do things you would have never done; why did you do them?
I really cannot tell.</description>

      <description>After much struggle our forces fought their way to a strong position on the front of the dvayaM daNDakAH. We were close to taking this much desired and important outpost after a really long drawn conflict. But, just then the news reached us on the khANDavan front that something we always suspected from the fateful day of Nov 30, 2004 was true. It put us in an even more complicated mess on that front.</description>

      <description>Jx had procured himself a cell phone. After some time somAkhya had also purchased a cell phone. Jx had all kinds of problems with his phone. Everyone who would look at Jx’s phone would say: “Wow that is a great phone.” All features we want is there in it they would say. But Jx would shake his head and say it just does not work. They would take his phone and place a call and ask their friends to call back and they all felt it worked fine.</description>

      <description>Since the Atman, which merely watches, is poised to cast away its sharIra and the old corpses shall lie on the path of no return, as though marked by the dance of sharva, we shall narrate those old events that we shall probably never get to talk of, once we walk ahead on the path. The tale of the yogi prince of Shri Lanka who was offered putrid food by the Dakini in the house of pleasure in bhArata came to our mind.</description>

      <description>For the first time in our reign did we find the kingdom in such an existential crisis emerging from our earlier conquest of khANDavaprasta. We checked all past events- it looked as though most of our mantras had worked. But the enemies were very numerous and all it took was a small chink in the armour to break through. We have exactly 8 days to grind out one of our main adversaries and the kR^ityA is raining hell all the while.</description>

      <description>-Our shachiva for the first time was shaken by the hit but could not do much useful at all. We still hold on to him as he has always been trustworthy at the last ditch attempt, which cannot be achieved without his abilities in that direction.
-Our amAtya made a valiant attempt with the mantras. We saw it take on the kR^ityA, but it eventually lost and our amAtya was beaten thoroughly.</description>

      <description>We saw that kR^ityAstra course towards us and hit us even before we could do much. The muni’s efforts were blown to bits, the amAtya was tossed aside like a twig in a storm, the shachiva simply ran away from the scene. The effects are rather sapping- it just wears you out, and tries to eat out and completely destroy your mantra bala. For sometime we did not know what hit us, as though the deadly dhUmAvatI had been sent to devour us.</description>

      <description>The clansmen got to gether to take stock of the proceedings. The case of Jx was remarkable. He had been pinned down by the attack of the vairi-s who were deluding him. He finally woke up on that fateful Monday morning. His purohita pressed home with the fierce attack that hurled arrows like a hail on the attack. His vairi-s were completely gone. They were gone like the sky blown clean of all the clouds to reveal the azure heights, with nothing but the midday sun blazing on the cobalt vault.</description>

      <description>We repulsed another attack on our position by the brigade from dundubhidurga. Seeing that dundudbhidurga was strategically placed to fire rockets at us, we decided to use the confusion of our foe to take the fort. I set out with a force of commandos and attacked dundubhidurga. We detonated a part of the wall an got in. We face some opposition but as our men had taken the commanding heights we were able to kill the defenders.</description>

      <description>We were waiting quietly on the undergrowth beside the banks of the River mahAsankaTa. There was a tense silence in the air. We had performed our karma to the best we could, but were indeed limited by our terrible short comings. Would we tide over it? Time would tell, but would we be around to receive the answer? There was no going back now. The war had been declared. The previous encounters and their results flashed in our minds eye.</description>

      <description>“In the time of the Hellenes and during the early days of the empire of the Rum the sciences were honoured and enjoyed universal respect. From an already solid and grandiose foundation, they were raised to greater heights every day, until the Christian religion made its appearance among the Rum; this was a fatal blow to the edifice of learning; its traces disappeared and its pathways were effaced”
-Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Masudi, the scientist from Baghdad, who lived in the 900s of the CE.</description>

      <description>The dumAvatI agent has a very special means of attack. It tries to destroy all the supporting systems and armors, and then zeroes in on the victim. It pressed ahead with the attempt at mAraNa. We parleyed with the agent: it revealed a peculiar prayoga of the type only known to me previously in the bauddha context. The mAraNa was to indirectly achieved via a linkage to second person. This was similar to the fate of nagArjuna when he met his end.</description>

      <description>We had assembled for the gathering- me, durmukha, maireyapayin, mUlApasmara, vAta vyAdi, mlechCha sundarI, kavargA, harir-bArava all sahakuTumba. Glad to have escaped the tIkShNa hima we settled down to reel out the yarns. The conversation drifted to the journey that we had made with kalashajA to the hills in central India, where apparently bhasmasura had placed his hand on his head. kalashajA’s mother had provided us with the contact of a pious brAhmaNa woman who was civil servant in those regions held by the Dravidian tribes.</description>

      <description>Intro The problem of the origin of the royal Bhosles, or the clan of Shivaji the reviver of Hindu fortunes, has interested me at various points due to a variety of reasons. I had come across the notorious stone inscription in Thanjavur that gave a peculiar genealogy that did not match any other genealogy from Maharashtra.
shUdra → kShatriya During my peregrinations in the Maharatta country I came across tribal Bhosles who were cattle-herders, and many other tribal groups bearing traditionally Maharatta last names- e.</description>

      <description>What ever happened after we passed on to the other side of the guillotine we were not sure. Evidentally at that point we did not know if the guillotine had fallen or not. In reality the English encounter was the begining of the troubles. We got past the deployer of the ghora dUradR^iShTi vidyA and were resting silently. We then wandered on the Deccan plains in the year 2002, when are our armies were still unstoppable, and had a brief wandering with the muni who was declining towards the abyss.</description>

      <description>We saw the wonderous charms of Hayastanika fade behind the impenetrable veils. We conjured memories of eating the wonderous superhot mango pickle on a pleasant spring afternoon and talking of the “pancha-shara mulapadhArta” with the wonderful Kappa on the wonderful summer day in the high mountains – they were both similar. We were reminded of the distant afternoon of the “curtain” where we experienced the pleasures of R’s company. Our reverie, as the pleasures of existence, was broken by the call from Jx.</description>

      <description>Fancying myself as the wandering vrAtya I wandered in the mAnuSha lokaH. I noticed many leaving images in the eye and then in the brain. At face value these images are useless, but who knows, they may be the well-springs of future thoughts on the great moha. I appreciate daNDin that jewel of the bR^ihatcharaNa-s because of the word “bhramati”. I wandered beside the river holding my kapAla given to silence observing all.</description>

      <description>We flew up again with the yakShini. There we stood in the mid-welkin and bewitching yakShini whispered in my ear:
“We need to talk about about a profound question”.
Me: What is it?
Y: Of all those sexually reproducing beings out there, the majority of them are heterogamous There are some like Chlamydomonas that produce similar-looking gametes- the male and female gametes are the same. But the majority of cases have converged on clear anisogamy or heterogamy.</description>

      <description>One of the most fateful events in Hindu history was the battle of Talikota that occurred during the time of Ramaraya who was the de facto ruler of Vijayanagar. Several attempts have been made by secularist writers to paint Ramaraya as a villain and downplay his eventful reign. He did commit miscalculations in different directions: 1) He killed many of Hindu Nayakas and replaced them by his own clansmen resulting in considerable discontent amongst the Hindu elite.</description>

      <description>kR^iShamukha and paraShumukha organized their attack at us with the deep hate and hope of overthrowing us for good– the mahochChATanaM. We were enveloped by the kR^ityA-s of dhUmAvatI that they had sent. Our senAnI had warned us well of what was approaching. We paused for a moment and decided that we must break up kR^iShamukha and paraShumukha as well as their spells as we had done to yUpa-shiras and matsya-pucCha-shiras in that great battle of dvAdasha.</description>

The one who knows this rahasya and performs the invocation of sumukhI along with the great dhUrtasvamI will be favored by them. That glorious goddess sumukhI also called the great mahAmayUrI, engaged in amorous dalliance with the dhUrta, is described as sulabhAgati. In the midst of her yantra, the mate of kArttikeya is meditated as residing and invoked with the mighty mantra (in mantra shAstra code):</description>

      <description>The shR^i~NgAra-parituShTIya sAra is viewed with intense embarrassment by the modern Hindu. At every level he or she would not like to believe that such texts were composed by their ancestors. I admit that literally translating some of its terms might sound embarrassingly absurd, but I suspect they are not supposed to sound as foolish as the literal translations are. But then I am not the kind of Hindu who is “modern” in outlook, and still linger on in the early centuries of the Hindu era.</description>

We were so dazzled by her that we felt completely speechless and humble.</description>

      <description>On the path of nothingness we returned;
before us stood the bright prajApati,
with rudra’s bright dart pinning him to the welkin.
In one hand we held an iron trident,
in the other we held a skull.
Beyond the carcass of prajapati
shone his wain, with the ruddy gem in it struck.
Further ahead shone the six mothers,
of our patron god with the spear.
Around us stood the city’s denizens.</description>

      <description>The muni and me were in a sense like branches of the same tree. We wondered what might have happened if only the muni and me could have joined our forces on the battle field. Our coordination on the field was unmatched. We saw eye-to-eye in the conduct of campaigns and the like. The only difference was that we matured at different times. I grabbed the vidyAs when they had to be acquired, but the muni ambulated in a random walk for long before he achieved them.</description>

      <description>nakula the 4th pANDava asked the kuru grandsire on his arrowy death bed about the origin of the sword. nakula said that he believed that the sword was a superior weapon and even if one lost his bow or horse or chariot one could still defend himself against mace and spear wielders if one were a good swordsman.
bhIshma replied that he was excited beyond words by that question and began to utter a narrative.</description>

      <description>The chance for the kuriltai was unusually solidified by the bold Argentinian adventurer. At the said hour we met with Mn and the shachiva’s prime agent. Mn, was a pioneer and even bolder adventurer than the Argentinian and was as ever silent, but he was shaken the strikes close to home. The shachiva’s agent who had maintained silence all this while, suddenly gave in to revealing the secrets of Jx. We were surprised the precision with which the shachiva’s agent described the various issues surrounding the rAkShasi.</description>

      <description>The paths of the yakShiNi 

After having been pursued relentlessly by the kR^ityA sent against us we reached the place known as the Dismal Hollows. There we entered The House and called up the yakShiNi again. She came forth even as agni had shot up when praised by the hymns of the long gone fathers, bhR^igu, ushana kAvya, apanavAna and aurva. She created that shield that kept of the kR^ityA from coming through.</description>

      <description>Now we shall narrate the great AkhyAnaM of the vItihotras and the kAshirAjas.
The vItahavya the descendent of sahasrArjuna, had restored the glory of the haihayas after it was destroyed by rAmo bhArgava. He and his numerous sons the vItahavyas were well-versed in the vedas and the science of weapons, and were fierce warriors. They planned a great raid on the kingdom of kAshI, when haryashva was its ruler. Having forded the yamuna, vItahavya and his sons swept into the territory of the kAshis by surprise.</description>

      <description>R told me that her amongst her chosen devatAs whose mantras are perfect with her is bagalAmukhI. Fourier of maNgalagrAma, was initiated into bagalAmukhI vidyAs by the powerful chera magician. bagalAmukhi deployments can be terrifying for the victim and there are many of them that are generally kept secret. Some bagalAmukhi deployment that I have come across include:
   the dhattUra haritAla lepana prayoga- the yellow orpinient made from a mixture of dhattUra bIja and turmeric which can used for stambhana and vashikaraNa.</description>

      <description>It was late summer or early autumn in the year of dvAdashAnta. R and I went to that house in the afternoon. Our acquaintences were busy trying to prepare for some exam, which at least to us seemed distant. They were chattering about text books, tuitions and other quintessentially Indian fascinations. We suddenly broke away from the chatter of the plebeians. The dark one who tended to be with me decided to go away to immerse himself in this more mundane business.</description>

His son Bajirao, and successor was the greatest luminary of this community who in his brief lifespan achieved success that nearly unmatched by any other Hindu general before him. The one other man of his jAti, who came close to his level of glory was Balgangadhar Tilak- the man who led India’s struggle against the Chrisitian tyrants from England.</description>

      <description>Mn, Jx and me assembled for the long awaited Kuriltai of the clan on the steppes. The only one missing from our old clan assembly was the muni, who was doing his time beside the somesha shrine where we spent the most liberated days of our existence when our aged clansmen who have now attained vaivasvata were still alive. Those days were our introduction to the sanAtana dharma and aswell as the seeds of our future.</description>

      <description>Paying with debt Via svembu.
Policies for favorable trade balance  Countries adopt &amp;ldquo;beggar thy neighbour&amp;rdquo; policies. i.e, currency suppression to promote exports - China, Germany, Japan all do it - is one reason. This is based on the mercantalist fallacy &amp;ldquo;we only sell&amp;rdquo;. China has achieved these surpluses by suppressing domestic consumption and focusing on exports.  Problem  There is a Tamil sign we used to see in shops: கடன் உறவைக் கெடுக்கும் (debt destroys relationships).</description>

      <description>Negotiable instruments Aka Securities. These are objects which promise payment to whoever holds the object. They include: stocks/ equities (which represent ownership in various businesses/ funds), bonds (loans), derivatives (whose value is determined based on the value of other instruments).
Creating securities Investment bankers help raise capital for various businesses by creating bonds and stocks. They get big fees for it.
Underwriting They often take the responsibility of selling such securities by purchasing it from the business and holding on to them - usually until they can sell it.</description>

      <description>Structure Unrefined fats include double bonds in the carbon chain, which lead to a molecular structure which is not a straight chain. Upon hydrogenation, single bonds are formed in place of double bonds, with a strong preference for the formation of trans-hydrocarbon backbone rather than cis-bonds. Such molecules have a more linear structure.
Hydrogenated oil Most trans fats consumed today, however, are industrially created as a side effect of partial hydrogenation of plant oils.</description>

      <description>Based on similarity and dissimilarity of genomes, one can organize various species / classes of organisms into a tree.
Species of cellular life The top branches (superregna) are: archaea, bacteria and eukaryota (true nucleus). The prior two are called prokaryota (primitive - neucleus).
The top branches of Eukaryota (regna) include plants, animals, fungi and protista (amoeba and some other primitive classes of organisms).
A notable branch of animals include the phylum chordata - subphylum vertebrata.</description>

      <description>Seeing that our foes had not fired the expected salvos, we were growing curious like the legendary cat. There was a heated discussion amongst our staff whether to counter-attack or lie and wait. While we had gained an advantage on front #3, a counter-attack could prove costly, as our resources had run out. Towards night I could not bear the wait and ordered a cautious counter-attack. The hostile forces behaved unusually.</description>

      <description>We walked up the path of the hill of the vAnara, when the dasyus were not its rulers yet. There was a glorious cleft on the side of the hillock, which led to a deep valley with wonderfully eroded paths. There a cool breeze often blew and we wandered around with the muni, kumbhodbhavA, and occasionally kR^iShNavarNa and the rAmAnujavAdin. The muni and myself had installed a installed a large li~Nga there for the worship of The god in the cleft and worshipped it with the brAhmi plant and the sha~Nka puShpa.</description>

      <description>Intro  Unschooling is an educational method and philosophy that advocates learner-chosen activities as a primary means for learning. &amp;ldquo;Unschooling is education whereby the learner determines what he learns (content, pace, depth), when he learns it (any age, or not at all), where his learns (home, community, online or school) and how he learns (self-taught, teacher-taught, facilitated, classroom, apprenticeship, online, correspondence, book, video, game, experiential, lecture, volunteering, project, job, or travel).</description>

      <description>General economy USA has high trade deficit: especially with oil producing countries and manufacturers like China.
GDP Growth is much lower than in emerging economies: 0-3%.
Industry USA’s industry is highly innovative - one of the best in the world. Industries are highly mechanized.
Manufacturing America is the biggest manufacturer of goods in the world. But, much of the manufacturing is done in highly automated factories which are run by a handful of skilled employees overseeing the automation; manufacturing involving low skilled labour has moved to countries (in the developing world) with cheaper labor.</description>

      <description>Tocharians and shaka-s → uighur (with significant genetic input)   The Uighur Turks, who absorbed the earlier Indo-European Tocharian civilization, showed how a genuine steppe potentate, which mixes militarism directed against sedentary populations and trade with them, could emerge. Notably, they laid the foundations for many aspects of the government of a steppe empire, which the later Mongols would adopt. These included the first script of the Chingizid Mongols.</description>

      <description>Principle  You inject antigens into the body (or infect it with mRNAs or viruses to produce those antigens). Then antibodies are generated, which last for a certain duration. Booster doses might increase the duration.  Inactivated viruses  You kill/ attenuate virus particles. Add Adjuvants, which stimulate the immune system to boost its response to a vaccine. Eg. Polio, Rabies, Hep A.  Efficacy  Vaccine efficacy - % reduction in disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group under optimal conditions Vaccine effectiveness - ability of vaccine to prevent outcomes of interest in the “real world” For some vaccines, booster dose increases efficacy.</description>

      <description>Effectiveness expectations  There are different strains - so vaccination may not be totally effective (just as in case of reinfection). Flare-up possibility: The antibodies the vaccine elicits will have virus neutralizing capabilities and that is what needed. But there are other non neutralizing antibodies that gets produced that can flare up the disease. Called ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) has been observed in Dengue and other viral infections.  Risks    Those who are taking vaccines now may become complacent and not wear masks    The others not vaccinated seeing those getting vaccinated might assume they are protected and not bother    People might just take one shot and drop out for the second    Those vaccinated assume they are protected immediately after the shots which is not true    People would like to wait to get vaccinated.</description>

      <description>The great brAhmaNa vAchaspati mishra, who was described as “sarva tantra svatantra” provides a model that is equivalent to the 3D cartesian system in his work nyAya vartika tAtparya TIkA (4.2.25) to describe molecular/atomic contacts. The 3 axes were termed pUrva-pashchima, uttara-dakShiNa and urdhva-adhara. The position of any point is given by measuring the the distance along these direction. The position of contacts between atoms can then be given as numerical series of these coordinates.</description>

      <description>virus-lineages-202102   Strain difference Some strains are much more infectious.
Original is called: Victoria.
20J/501Y.V3 or P.1  Manaus, Brazil 2-2.5 times more transmissible and proving to be lethal. Brazil used Chinese Sinovac vaccine which has lesser protection against the mutants.  VOC-202012/01, B.1.1.7, 20I/501Y.V1 Mutations  N501Y. Slight change in highly variable protein region here. One claim is that plasma therapy triggered it. It has acquired another troublesome mutation E484 (found earlier in South Africa strain) which makes it adopted well to escape out from antibodies,cause re-infections and lessened vaccine efficacy.</description>

      <description>Similarity measures between u and v are inverses of distance metrics.
Based on paths and random walks  (shortest path).  Katz measure \(sim(u,v) = \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} \gb^{l}|paths_{u,v}(l)|\). Matrix of scores, \(K = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \gb^{i}A^{i}\).
The damping parameter \(K = (I - \gb A)^{-1} - I\) if the sum converges. Use \(A = U\EW U^{*}\): EW decomposition, with \(\ew_{i}\) ordered in descending order. \(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \gb^{i}A^{i} = U(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \gb^{i}\EW^{i})U^{*}\) does not converge \(\forall \gb \geq 0\) and multiplication by \(\infty\) is not well defined.</description>

Even though the origin of the Vestals is said to be made by the legendary king Numa Pompilius, their origin is probably much older. Originally, the temple of Vesta was in the shape of a round hut made out of straw and clay with a pointed roof where the girls took care of the fire.</description>

Wie eine Schildwach, im Grabe,
Bis einst ich höre Kanonengebrüll
Und wiehernder Rosse Getrabe.
Dann reitet mein Kaiser wohl über mein Grab,
Viel Schwerter klirren und blitzen;
Dann steig ich gewaffnet hervor aus dem Grab,
Den Kaiser, den Kaiser zu schützen.

      <description>Very little has been recorded of the valiant freedom struggle in the Konkan in the horror years of Indian history. The Konkans on the west coast of India had long been the bastion of the Indic civilization that withstood external attacks due to the protective influence of the Western Ghats. The first major wave of Islamic onslaughts on the region was initiated by Alla-ad-din Khalji when he dispatched his ace commander Maliq Kaffr to wage Jihad on the ancient dynasty of the Kadambas, who were the principal rulers of the Konkans.</description>

      <description>Asian Paints SmartCare Damp Proof Ultra White  PU hybrid polymers and reinforcing acrylic fibers. PU is biodegradable but not acrylic. Bridges cracks - provides water proofing (10 yrs guarantee with top coat). 10 deg temperature reduction.  Aerogel based application  aerogel is basically porous material a silicone + polyurethane type material most likely. The latter would be less because UV stability would be an issue with aromatic PU and aliphatic ones are slow reacting and expensive.</description>

      <description>The varanopids are a lineage of synapsids whose distinctness and wide distribution has come to light more recently, even though Romer described Varanops elegantly in his early monographs. More recently Reisz and Laurin, the experts on these topics, described a relatively large varanopid, Watongia, from the Oklahoma Chickasha formation. This synapsid was discovered by Olson in 1974 but was poorly understood until a few years ago. Watongia appears to share a hallmark feature of two other varanopids, namely the postorbital tuberosity if the authors’ interpretation of the skull is correct.</description>

      <description>Marc, R and I had a strange philosophical discussion this week end, when perhaps we could have spent time in more practical but rewarding things.
R and I have for long been what may be termed bhUta chaitanya vAdins in the old Hindu parlance. We essentially believed that consciousness arose from the neural material. Marc though somewhat closer to electron orbitals than either of us in his daily existence made a strange statement: I seem to accept the reality of consciousness much more than you two, despite you all being born Hindus.</description>

      <description>Some web-services expose API to allow algorithmic access to the information they serve.
Request/ response format They specify the serialization formats in which input/ request and output/ response objects (structured data) are to be encoded. This is usually in JSON or XML format.
XML, being more verbose, results in slower computation and transmission.
Underlying Protocol Usually, they use http or rpc protocol.
Web interface Protocols Simple Object access protocol (SOAP) It specifies the use of XML for representing objects, certain Message Exchange Patterns (MEP).</description>

      <description>Americans are particularly interested in knowing about a person’s race, just as we might be curious about a person’s varNa or jAti. In any paper-work, be it of small or big importance, the American officialdom demands to known your race. Indians living in the mlechCha-desha often have a profound difficulty with this matter because despite comprising a 1/6 th of humanity they do not have a race to describe them. The common categories imposed by the Americans are white, black, Native American, Asian, and “Pacific Islanders”.</description>

      <description>We have seen many things in life. But never have we seen something hit us as overwhelming as this. There was revolt in khANDavaprastha. It looked as though kumbhakarNa was standing there on the field and marching steadily towards us. What ever astra we hurled at kumbhakarNa simply broke to pieces and fell down. But kumbhakarNa, unaffected moved on. It was terrifying to stand there and watch all our weapons crumble like that as behemoth advanced towards us.</description>

      <description>Situational awareness In stationary water, the direction of the wind may be determined from the waves. Or one may use the sail.
Preparing the boat While sailing, the fin under the center board should be down in the water. The aft fin/ skeg is always down.
Mechanics The sail and the fin operate on the same principle as an airplane wing. Critical forces are lift and drag. The lift generated by the sail is at an angle to the orientation of the board defined by the relative orientation of the sail.</description>

The latter may be powered by UPS systems (inverters backed by DC battery) - by putting them downstream from UPS output.   Fuses or trip switches at switch boards and even at the plug point. 2 way switches for staircase lights, bedroom lights and fans. Good placement anticipating appliances like AC, fan, lights. Power generated in the household (solar, wind&amp;hellip;) may need to be consumed preferentially - or dumped to the grid.</description>

Collaborative filtering Latent factor approach Assume small number of latent random variables, which combine together to form various view points and data points, cause the labels.
Low rank factorization Let values of latent RV behind data pt j be \(v_{j}\), behind viewpoint i be \(u_{i}\); then get \(Y_{i,j} = u_{i}^{T}v_{j}\).</description>

Binary classification See the many hypothesis classes/ parametrized model families in the colt ref, boolean functions ref.
Non parametric methods k nearest neighbors A discriminative, non parametric approach. Number of examples: N. Samples: \(S = (x_{1}, .. x_{N})\). There are \(k\) classes. To classify \(x\), find \(k\) nearest neighbors in S; take their majority vote.
So, can&amp;rsquo;t ever throw away data points.

The underlying process is such that the distribution of \(L_{n+1}\) depends on both \(S\) and \(X_{n+1}\).
Simplifications Even predicting a lower bound or upper bound (whp) of \(L_{n+1}\) may be useful.

      <description>Memory hierarchy Memory access could be 100 times slower than flops: this is an important consideration when optimizing algorithms. Hence, there is a hierarchy of memory:
Registers in the processor \(&amp;gt;\) On chip Cache: many layers \(&amp;gt;\) main memory \(&amp;gt;\) secondary memory located on the hard-disk for example.
Glossary SDRAM  Working memory is capable of random, rather than serial, access. Also, it is dynamic - it retains data only when supplied electricity to periodically refresh its memory.</description>

      <description>Objectives To publicize an important discovery, and submit it for criticism and improvement.
Let it be Explanatory Telling a story Write as if you are writing a story. The abstract and the conclusion should contain mostly the same text, except one may say ’we will show’, and the other should say ’we have shown’.
Don’t try to sound impressive Academics have the bad habit of using jargon and stilted prose. Explanatory writing sounds less impressive, and is longer.</description>

      <description>Anandavardhana was a remarkable figure. In my Sanskrit learning I gave him the skip because the theory and practice of alaMkAra never struck a chord in me in my youth (I also had a great excuse). My mother spoke of a lot of theory and practice of alaMkAra literature but I realized soon that her way of conveying it was not at all for me. In any case my then AchArya found my excuse convincing and maintained that we could continue with analysis of the yajur vedic prose when I returned.</description>

      <description>GK had been a rival of R. R had genuine knowledge, but GK merely absorbed everything she read without much analysis or understanding. Otherwise they were quite equally matched. GK oozed arrogance, but R emanated genuine mental superiority over most. GK always had the ethnic advantage in both the lokas, but R was in the “foreigners” category. Still R was victorious over GK till the fourth year, after which she departed for the quest of “higher glory”.</description>

      <description>A group of nAga-s inspired, by rAni Gaidinliu, has remained heathen, and has successfully resisted Christianization in Nagaland.
Syncretism with Hinduism From Longkumer’s thesis (pdf link):
 The ideology of the RSS and VHP has already seeped into Heraka rhetoric and their talk is often peppered with these nation-building bumper stickers. Phrases such as ‘all religions have truth, compassion, and love and are like streams that go into the one ocean’ or ‘invasion of foreign religion and foreign culture will bring total destruction of Naga society.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites After our own experience in Homeschooling and listening to our various mentors. Here are three most important things that form the foundation for successful homeschooling
Foundation #1 Wife and Husband have to agree that Homeschooling/Unschooling is the way forward. It is important to invest time to figure out why you both are embracing homeschooling. It is ok for wife and husband to have differing opinions on ways to homeschool (it is natural and that difference in methods of Homeschooling is required, kids will adapt easily).</description>

      <description>mAhatyam. Critical channel in transmission of yoga-paramparA (others being shivAnanda . .) from samnyAsI-s. As Yoga Journal described in an article entitled, &amp;ldquo;The Legacy of Krishnamacharya,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;You may never have heard of him but Tirumalai Krishnamacharya influenced or perhaps even invented your yoga. Whether you practice the dynamic series of Pattabhi Jois, the refined alignments of B.K.S. Iyengar, the classical postures of Indra Devi, or the customized vinyasa of Viniyoga, your practice stems from one source: a five-foot, two-inch Brahmin born more than one hundred years ago in a small South Indian village.</description>

      <description>The Brahmanda Purana gives a different account. It says that Bhrigu had two wives — Divya who was the daughter of Hiranyakashipu and Paulomi, the daughter of Puloman. Divya gave birth to Sukra who is identified as Ushanas and Kavya, along with the 12 Bhrigu Gods (who I presume are the same as the 12 Yajnika Devas mentioned in Matsya Purana).

      <description>परिवारः A fine mulukunADu brAhmaNa. He hailed from a traditional, erudite household. (Birth: 4th November 1893 in Nanjangud, Mysore. Death: 7th January 1971 in Bangalore). Though he was born ‘Sitarama Jois,’ he became ‘Sitarama Shastri’ owing to his maternal uncles, i.e. brothers of his mother Parvatamma. The three brothers (Yajneshwara Shastri, Srikantha Shastri, and Krishna Shastri) were all eminent personalities. Srikantha Shastri was the chief officer in the Śṛṅgeri Maṭha; Krishna Shastri was the dharmādhikarī during the reign of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV.</description>

      <description>Inculcation of &amp;ldquo;asebeia&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;not believing in the gods of the state&amp;rdquo;) as an offense was introduced in ancient Greece and used as an easy way to prosecute philosophers. Socrates was killed on such a charge (though devout, there were political problems with him as a gadfly irritating the Athenian horse, though ).  &amp;ldquo;The specifics of the charge were that his reference to his personal daimōn constituted an attempt to introduce a new illicit cult, which would have been centered upon himself.</description>

      <description>Robust intellectual response to Christianity  The neo-platonist tradition and lineage is described in the platonist page.  Christian appropriation  Appropriation of classical (hellenic) thought  socrates, plato etc.. were excellent polytheists. &amp;ldquo;a man (Socrates) who by his own testimony was on a mission from Apollon.&amp;rdquo;   &amp;ldquo;Through Augustine (354–430) in the West and the 4th-century Cappadocian Fathers (Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus) in the East as well as the pseudo-epigraphic writings of Dionysius the Areopagite (early 6th century), Neoplatonism profoundly influenced the emergence of mainstream and not so mainstream Christian theology (John Scotus Eriugena, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Meister Eckhart).</description>

      <description>Summary  Christians were far more willing to take consistent and forceful political action in favor of their religion (rather than &amp;ldquo;Rome&amp;rdquo;). The diverse pagan traditions in the Empire didn&amp;rsquo;t begin to think of themselves as one religion until the Christians in power began taking uniform action against them.  Constantine and Constantius 324-361  We see a pattern of slow start, followed by a sudden quickening. Privileging christians: &amp;ldquo;Constantine himself apparently endorsed this goal and tried to further it through a series of legislative and administrative measures.</description>
