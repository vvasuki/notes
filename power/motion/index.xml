      <description>Parameters  Suction power. Should suffice to change air 10 times per hour.  Alternate guide: If kitchen is in separate room, 600 m3/h suffices. Else, good to go for 1200 m3/h.   Size: 60x60 (2-4 burners), 90cm (3-5 burners) Autoclean: Better suction power and life.  Turbine blower forces air to move to chimney walls (oil goes thence to a collection bowl, which should be washed every month). Thermal auto-clean - evaporate oil etc from insides of motor.</description>

      <description>Washing machines are more water efficient than hand washing - but consume more electricity (obviously).
Front loaders seem to use less water, result in less water retention in clothes, are more energy efficient - RW. But as of 2020, top loaders seem to be catching up.</description>

      <description>Situation  Standard dimensions noted elsewhere. &amp;ldquo;drain pipe run on the floor level or at a certain height. - The drain water comes out from machine through a pump. As per the specification of the machine this can pump drain water up to approximately 1m height.&amp;rdquo; Not suitable for use with hard-water (borewell).+++(5)+++  Cost  Running cost 2020 INR - Electricity ~ 150 Consumables ~ 200 . Time: 10 minutes per loading.</description>

      <description>Types  Gearless (no oil, less energy) geared Hydraulic. (No pit needed. BUt more maintenance.)  Features  Coated steel belts - zero lubrication. Need for machine room. Finishing - Stainless steel vs fabric. Door opening: Automatic vs manual. Side telescopic vs center. Safety: typically allow getting descending to the next lower floor in case of power loss.  Space  Typical Pit depth 1350mm = 53.14 in  Cost Installation  Depends on capacity, number of stops, technology, lift permit, scaffolding, electrical work.</description>

      <description>They donâ€™t cool rooms, they just provide air circulation in the room to cool you.  Metrics  Air Delivery : example 225 CMM (Cubic Meters per Minute) Number of blades  More blades - less speed, but also less noisy.   Blade sweep. In ceiling fans: 600mm (2ft), 1200 mm (4 ft), 1400mm (5 ft) are common. Greater sweep is like adding more blades plus greater reach for air.</description>
