      <description>Purpose Avoid the discomfort of having to squint at the sun. Or remove glare from either the computer screen or from reflected light. Or improve visibility at night.
Choices Buy some light safety glasses which fit over prescription eye-glasses, with either smoke or yellow tinted lenses. Sunglasses should ideally cover the entire visual range where the sun strikes the eyes: even the top. For this reason, clip-on sunglasses are inadequate.</description>

      <description>Heavy or formal use Use water proof, breathable boots, with minimal heaviness. It must be usable even on formal occasions.
Lace Shoes that donâ€™t require lace-tying are generally looser and more uncomfortable during brisk walks.
There are shoes which can be easily (un)tied by just pulling a loop. Use these.
Use easy to tie lace: lock/ elastic/ speed/ quick/ lace.
Avoid plastic shoes Leather boots, rather than plastic boots, are breathable.</description>

      <title>Slippers</title>

      <description>Eco-friendliness  Choices: Rubber, jute, leather, rarely wood. But, many rubber/ jute slippers come with plastic straps and soles - not biodegradable. Best choice considering what&amp;rsquo;s available commonly and cheaply: Slippers with rubber soles (oft with polyurathene covering) and jute straps. Seems that polyurathene is sort-of biodegradable (40 yrs).  Comparison with shoes Adherance Slippers in general, adhere more lightly to the bottom of the feet than shoes do. Among slippers too, there are different levels of adherence.</description>

      <description>Use thick jockey socks: less smelly.
Or consider materials which wick away moisture.</description>

      <description>Buy sunscreen with high SPF, but avoid ones with oxytocin (a synthetic estrogen which easily penetrates the skin).</description>
