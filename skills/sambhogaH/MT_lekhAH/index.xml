      <description>The shR^i~NgAra-parituShTIya sAra is viewed with intense embarrassment by the modern Hindu. At every level he or she would not like to believe that such texts were composed by their ancestors. I admit that literally translating some of its terms might sound embarrassingly absurd, but I suspect they are not supposed to sound as foolish as the literal translations are. But then I am not the kind of Hindu who is “modern” in outlook, and still linger on in the early centuries of the Hindu era.</description>
