      <description>Most floor finishes are water-based acrylic copolymers suitable for use under normal foot traffic.  Natural oils  Earthen floors can be sealed with drying oils. Drying oils polymerize as they dry, on interacting with oxygen. Typically: Linseed oil and Tung Oil. Solvents let the oil penetrate the floor better.  Dazlo  Dazlo Floor Wax is not available at any retail shop in Bangalore. So you will have to order it through Amazon or directly through us.</description>

      <description>Asian Paints SmartCare Damp Proof Ultra White  PU hybrid polymers and reinforcing acrylic fibers. PU is biodegradable but not acrylic. Bridges cracks - provides water proofing (10 yrs guarantee with top coat). 10 deg temperature reduction.  Aerogel based application  aerogel is basically porous material a silicone + polyurethane type material most likely. The latter would be less because UV stability would be an issue with aromatic PU and aliphatic ones are slow reacting and expensive.</description>
