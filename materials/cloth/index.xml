      <title>Breathability</title>

      <description>It is the weave of the fabric (the size and number of holes) that determines breathability or resistance to air movement. Any woven or knit fabric will breathe - even if the weave is made of rubber strands.
If the yarn on the outside of the garment is thinner than the yarn on the inside of the garment, capillary action will pull water to the outside. The increased surface area (not hollow fibre cores) of the thin yarn gives the water more space to spread out.</description>

      <description>Light, but breaks down with use. Excellent warmth to weight ratio. the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet; so good in combination with waterproof material.</description>

      <description>Rainclothes made out of tightly knit nylon are rain and wind proof, and are breathable.
Material which is water proof under 30000 mm of water is labelled water proof. Highly water proof material is also highly windproof.</description>
