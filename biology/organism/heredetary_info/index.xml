      <description>Recombinant DNA technology This is a cumbersome method of modification whereby gene fragments from one organism are inserted into vectors such as bacterial plasmids or viruses, which can then transfer them into the organism of interest. Though this technology had early successes in the 1970â€™s, its application was constrained due to limitations in scope and scale.
With CRISPR-Cas9 CRISPR/Cas9 edits genes by precisely cutting DNA and then letting natural DNA repair processes to take over.</description>
