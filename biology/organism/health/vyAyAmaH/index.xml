      <description> Researchers from the University of Michigan discovered that a session of aerobic exercise increases storage of fat in muscle, which actually improves insulin sensitivity. (Insulin resistance is an important part of Type-2 diabetes.) [Ref] beneficial to cognition during early and middle periods of the human lifespan and may continue to protect against age-related loss of cognitive function during older adulthood. Exercise causes the frontal lobes to increase in size.  </description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The aim of an interval (or HIIT) session is to arrive DOA at the end of the session not in the middle of the session&amp;rdquo; A 2005 study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that after just two weeks of interval training, six of the eight college-age men and women doubled their endurance, or the amount of time they could ride a bicycle at moderate intensity before exhaustion.</description>

      <description> &amp;ldquo;As a biological organism the human body is adaptive; more than that, it is antifragile, this is an important distinction in that things that are antifragile need stress to improve.&amp;rdquo; Sedentary lifestyle is a major underlying cause of death, disease, and disability. [Ref] It is characterized by sitting or remaining inactive for most of the day. [Ref]  </description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Think of running for the bus as earning your calories. Think of physical work as hunting for your food. Think of cycling fifty miles as tracking an antelope. Climbing trees, jumping over walls, running up stairs, fighting, throwing, sprinting – they&amp;rsquo;re reproducing things your ancient ancestors had to do to survive. Again; you have to expend your calories to get calories because the modern environment no longer forces you do it.</description>

      <description> Relaxed upper body swinging side to side with each step. When your feet land, make sure that knee angle is not obtuse (ie decelerating). For accelerating, obviously angle will be more acute. Long runs - &amp;quot; Do not run too fast early on, even if it feels slow, you will pay for it later!&amp;rdquo;  </description>

      <description>Stay at the lighter end of your body&amp;rsquo;s frame  Over-muscled, fueled by constantly eating, is not healthy    Physical Standards Via Guru Anaerobic:
 1 Deadlift: One-rep max of 2 x body weight (general strength) 2 Chin-ups: 20 (usable upper body strength) 3 100m sprint: Under 13 seconds (speed) 4 One mile: Under 6 minutes (endurance) 5 Body-fat: 10-12% - a six-pack is just visible (health)  These are not elite standards, but achieving all five would likely take you into the top 1% of the population.</description>
